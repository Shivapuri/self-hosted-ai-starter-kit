LILA-AMRIT means: "Miracles and Nectar of Divine Wisdom". It is the biography of Sri Mahaprabhuji, an incarnation of Divine Love and Wisdom, which is told by his successor, Paramhans Swami Madhavananda, who lived with Mahaprabhuji in Khatu Ashram in the desert of Rajasthan, India. Sri Mahaprabhuji's miraculous life, which was filled with divine bliss and wonders, was a divine blessing and liberation for all who came in touch with him. This chronicle is based on Swami Madhavanandaji's personal experiences, as well as on authentic material gathered from persons who lived with Mahaprabhuji. From his miraculous birth, through childhood, to the accomplishment and the completion of his divine mission, we see him as a young boy amazing a Sanskrit scholar with his innate knowledge of the cosmic order, bringing to life a dead girl and we read about his extraordinary initiation following the age-old tradition of Guru lineage of his divine master Sri Devpuriji, whose remarkable personality is also presented here. After the meeting with his Master, Mahaprabhuji stayed in his ashram at Bari Khatu, Rajasthan, where he spent most of his life, teaching and helping all who came to him, instructing and liberating his followers. The light of his wisdom and grace revealed to spiritual seekers their true Self and released them from the suffering and sorrows caused by illusion of ignorance. Mahaprabhuji's teachings also have been presented in beautiful bhajans or spiritual songs, many of which are translated here. Mahaprabhuji lived 135 years and left his physical body in 1963. In his every word and action, he revealed his unity with the divine wisdom and highest spiritual consciousness. This book also tells about some of his disciples, who spent several years in the holy presence of Sri Mahaprabhuji.

## [Introduction](https://www.lilaamrit.org/intro/introduction)

God is existent within each and every living being and as humans we have the possibility to realise our Divine descent. Yet only a rare few know of this inner treasure and set out to find it.

In all religions, worshipped as Saints, are those great Souls who have directly experienced God and dedicated their life to Him. But there is one fundamental difference between the Eastern and Western way of thought. In the West, these great Souls are acknowledged as Saints only after their death and not during their lifetime. Whereas in the East, the idea of a living Saint is absolutely conceivable — indeed fervently prayed for. God hears the prayer of His devotees and fulfils their wish through the birth of a Saint, so that the ordinary person too, may directly experience Him.

One such Saint was Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji, who lived from 1828 to 1963 in the state of Rajasthan, of North-West India. He was revered by thousands and many still live today who knew and worshipped him. Through his grace and blessing, God inspiration and God awareness was brought to many who had the privilege of meeting him. In the spirit of his teachings on Love and Truth, we begin to realize the true purpose and meaning of our human existence: to Love, Serve and Realize the Self.

In India, it is customary to show great veneration not only to Saints and Divine incarnations, but also to the spiritual teacher or mentor. It is through that person the spiritual aspirant obtains the valuable gift of Self-knowledge and Self-realization. Therefore, I wish to briefly comment on the terms used when speaking of that relationship between Master and Disciple.

In the Sanskrit language, a teacher or Master is called the Guru. 'Gu' means darkness and 'ru' means light. It is the Guru who leads us from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge. The Sanskrit word for disciple is shishya and this term infers complete and perfect devotion. The disciple yields the ego and is willing to undertake all to reach the goal. The realized spiritual Master is called brahma nishtha shrotria Satguru. This means that the Master possesses perfect control over the body, mind and senses - their path to God-realization has been completed and this transcendent knowledge can be imparted to others. The Satguru knows the teachings and Holy texts through personal experience and in this way conveys these to the disciple.

There are two types of Master. One gains perfection and God realization through long and arduous practice, being led to this perfection by his own Master. The other type of Master is born perfect — already born as a Master. The latter is a higher being, who incarnates with perfect abilities and who is thus described as a Divine Soul. The Master who has obtained a higher level of consciousness through persistent effort and practice is called a yogi, but that one who already possesses supernatural abilities from birth is called a mahasiddhyogi. Some worship their own personal God in the mahasiddhyogi and other spiritual seekers who are free thinkers, simply see the Master in the mahasiddhyogi.

No Master will ever boast of their wondrous abilities or deeds, nor describe themselves as the source of the highest power — not even if that Master does possess siddhis (supernatural abilities). Each Master acknowledges God as the source of all knowledge and all power, no matter whether one refers to God as the Omnipresent, or God as that personal form of his own Divine Master.

God the Supreme, may appear to us in two ways. One form of the Supreme, is God the Omnipotent, who is everywhere in everything — this aspect of God is formless. The other aspect of God, is God with form, the incarnated God-power. However, if we wish to grasp God with our intellect, it is rather like trying to pour the vast ocean into a teacup. Nevertheless, we still dare attempt intellectual explanations of God!

So how is the power of God, or the Divine will, manifest and displayed in human form? Such an incarnation accomplishes deeds which reach far beyond the capacity of the ordinary human being. Under His mercy, fire is transformed into ice, illness into good health, death into life. He knows the desire of every soul and is able to fulfil that desire. He knows our inner Self. His power has no limit. He is able to appear in several places at one time. He always was, always is and always will be. However, due to the barriers of our limited intellect and ego, we are denied this understanding and realization. Only through love may this be realized: God is Love and Love is God. The Universal form of the Divine is love and this love manifests as beauty in creation. Love and beauty always radiate from the presence of the Master.

What is a disciple? The disciple is one who seeks the knowledge and realization of his or her true Self. A disciple beginning the journey of spiritual evolution, does also possess those same qualities and abilities as their Master. Yet these are unknown and buried deep beneath layers of ignorance. The consciousness of the disciple is filled with illusion and delusion and so one feels helpless. It is tremendously difficult to be a disciple! The task of the disciple is even more difficult than that of the Guru, for it is not easy to surrender the small but very powerful ego.

Knowledge is infinite, it has no boundary and is gained only through practice and personal experience. In every phase of life, a teacher is needed in order to learn something. Therefore, to gain spiritual knowledge a spiritual Master is required. The disciple approaches the Master because of his or her quest for enlightenment, just as the thirsty person carries their water jug to the source of the water. The disciple should have complete trust in the Master and be firmly convinced that the Master will fulfil their desire for Self-realization.

The Master is the one who gives, the disciple is the one who receives. Master and disciple are like two candles. The Master is that candle whose flame brightly burns and the disciple is that candle which is yet unlit. For the flame of the disciple to burn, the disciple must come to the flame of the Master. This means to follow the words of the Master and learn.

Yoga is no ritual, but there is a series of systematic exercises to be followed and if practised with trust, disciplÌne and firm determination, these will lead to enlightenment: to God-realization. The exercises and techniques that the Master teaches the disciple, are from that ancient knowledge which has been passed down from Master to disciple for many thousands of years.

## [Preface](https://www.lilaamrit.org/intro/preface)

The lives of Saints are brilliant beacons on that path to the infinite Divine Light. The light of wisdom emanating from these Saints, radiates for all on the journey to Self-realization. Their deeds, lilas  and teachings, reveal the Divine Truth and are an invaluable guide for the spiritual seeker. To unveil this all-embracing truth means to fulfil the purpose of our life while gaining inspiration from those exemplary spiritual models. In this fulfilment we are imparted Divine knowledge, which we use to transcend the illusory world of maya  and we come to know that our consciousness is really embodied in the kingdom of the Immortal.

Without this knowledge of God, our spirit aimlessly wanders in darkness. Divine knowledge is that nectar for which all souls thirst and it is only by God's grace that this thirst is quenched.

The life of His Holiness Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji is full of this Divine ambrosia. It was my blessed good fortune to spend my life in his benevolent care and to journey on this spiritual path under his direct guidance.

Innumerable devotees, inspired by Mahaprabhuji's words, protected through his compassion and supported in their spiritual effort by his loving-kindness, repeatedly requested that I write his life story for the benefit and welfare of others. It was also my own ardent desire to record the life and teachings of my Divine Master and to pass on the blessing of his wisdom to all mankind. However, for a long time Mahaprabhuji did not give his consent. In his modesty, being beyond all earthly concerns, he denied my request for more than twenty years. Free of all desires, he cared not for fame of his name or person. But this Saviour of all souls, to whom I am devoted with my whole heart, finally granted my wish. It is a spiritual truth that sooner or later God will fulfil the pure wishes of His devotees.

Early in 1963, I received a letter from Mahaprabhuji inviting me to visit him at Khatu Ashram as soon as possible. The morning after my arrival he called me to him and revealed to me something extraordinary: that he would depart this world at five o'clock on the morning of the 5th December that same year.

He concluded by saying, "I have called you here to tell you this and to grant whatever wish you may desire. For if I do not fulfil it, who will?" I prostrated myself before him and repeated my oft-expressed request to be permitted to record the story of his life. My gracious Master smiled and replied, "Let it be so." My heart filled with joy. I felt like a beggar who had just received a treasure of immense value and I immediately got to work.

It is my pleasure to share with you these insights into the lives and deeds of Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji and his Master, Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji. I have recorded many of my own experiences here and set down a few glimpses of the miracles I have witnessed. I have also presented the personal accounts of many other devotees and disciples of Mahaprabhuji.

These words are offered for the benefit of all spiritual seekers. May they inspire you in your spiritual efforts and strengthen your faith. As for others, Lord Krishna said in The Bhagavad Gita: "The sceptics seek their own destruction" (Ch. 4, V. 40).

Due to our limited human consciousness, the world that we naively comprehend as reality, is in truth only a transient vision. It is the work of maya — the power of illusion. However, That which is full of transcendent awareness, That which is eternal, unchanging, undivided, Omnipresent and Omniscient, without definition, attribute or form, That which is unbound, pure and perfect, which has no beginning and no end, this vibration or energy fills the whole universe and in the Vedas it is called: OM

OM is reality. OM is truth. OM is the pure consciousness upon which all wise men and yogis meditate. OM is liberation and perfection. OM is the Divine. OM is the ultimate power which creates and preserves the cosmos. With reverent salutations I make my obeisance to OM.

From time to time the formless Divine power of OM manifests, or incarnates in human form on earth, for the benefit of the world. Such manifestations are recorded in all Holy scriptures.

We may ask why a Divine incarnation appears in this world and the answer is this. Sometimes there is such an overwhelming increase of negative power that it is only by God's intervention that a remedy can be found. God takes human form to strengthen justice and honesty among men, to protect the survival of right belief and to drive out all evil. Many people believe that only Rama, Krishna or Jesus could be such a Divine incarnation but such is a limited belief, for God may be present on earth in human form at any time. The possibility for God to incarnate is not limited by space or time, nor by number. If fire is burning in one place, does this mean that fire cannot burn elsewhere at the same time? Like fire, God can appear anywhere at any time.

God's willingness to incarnate for the benefit of His devotees is expressed in The Bhagavad Gita: "Although I am not born and am Myself immortal, although I am the Lord of all that exists, yet by My own will and power do I manifest myself. Whenever spirituality declines and evil is rampant, I incarnate myself. To strengthen and protect goodness and justice and to eliminate evil, I am reborn from age to age. Who in truth recognises my Divine birth and Divine works will not reincarnate on leaving their body, but will become one with me." (Ch. 4, V. 6-9).

Therefore we sing the mantra :

OM GURUR BRAHMA GURUR VISHNU GURUR DEVO MAHESHWARAH GURUH SAKSHAT PARABRAHMA TASMAI SRI GURUVE NAMAH

This mantra means that the Supreme Being, the "All-Self" present in every creature, adopts the form of Brahma  to create the world. The same Almighty One manifests in the form of Vishnu, the protector and preserver of the universe and is born as man to rescue human dharma . The same God also takes the form of Maheshwara (Shiva), the Liberator, who ultimately dissolves the cosmos into Himself again. For those who seek spiritual liberation this power or Divine will appears on earth as the Satguru (the true Master). Therefore I bow to the Divine Master.

But how is it possible for us to recognise such a wonderful event? The answer is very simple, at least in theory. A true messenger of God embodies in himself, all human virtues in their purest form. It is this perfection that signifies a true messenger of God.

The Divine incarnation is distinguished by unwavering loving-kindness, mercy and universal love. Selflessly serving the highest truth, he effects good for all creatures without judgement of race, nationality, gender, caste or status. The radiance of his light rescues the devotee from ignorance and attachment. A spark is kindled even in those of a callous or malicious character. Their consciousness is turned from the limits of time and space to the unlimited Divine Play.

The one in whom God is manifest comes to this world as a perfect being. From birth he is the Master of all that for which the seeker must labour. He is devoid of all fault or weakness. Admittedly, he has a body made up of physical elements, but he is beyond such matter and possesses all might and power over the laws of the cosmos.

As already mentioned, theoretically it may be easy to identify a Saint, Satguru or Avatar . However, in practice it is only those who have acquired good karma in former lives who can find such a Master. Only they are the true seekers and only they recognize the Divine Light.

In The Bhagavad Gita, it is said: "At the end of many lives that one who is full of wisdom will unite in Me with the knowledge that Vasudeva (God) is everything. Such a great soul is hard to find." (Ch. 7, V. 9)

The great Indian Saint, Sunderdas, expressed this truth in the following poem: "The Satguru is the Supreme, he is God But the disciple only sees the human form, How can there be perfection Where there exists such ignorance?" The great and Holy poet Tulsidas, says in his epic poem, The Ramayana: "I worship my Satguru as God in human form, He is an ocean of blessing! His words are as clear and powerful as the Sun, They drive away the darkness of illusion.”

The Holy scriptures reveal to us the basic truth about the Satguru in this mantra:

DHYANA MULAM GURU MURTI PUJA MULAM GURU PADAM MANTRA MULAM GURU VAKYAM MOKSHA MULAM GURU KRIPA

"The essence of meditation is the transcendent form of the Guru. The essence of ceremonies is reverence for the Guru's lotus feet. The essence of mantra is the word of the Guru. The essence of liberation is the grace of the Guru."

For one who is blessed by the Satguru the impossible becomes possible. Those paralysed by ignorance reach the peak of knowledge. The blind who wander in the darkness of illusion see reality and those who have fallen silent through ignorance, speak the words of wisdom.

My Satguru, the Liberator of all souls, my Protector full of grace and love, is His Holiness, Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji. I will now attempt to describe his life. Paramhans Swami Madhavananda

## [INCARNATION](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation)

Lord Shiva was engrossed in deep contemplation of that which is eternal, Divine, all-embracing and beyond time and space. While he was in this state of cosmic consciousness, the Divine Self appeared before him in his highest manifestation of eternal brilliance: the light and sound of OM.

Becoming aware of his presence, Lord Shiva opened his eyes and bowed with reverence to the Supreme, the source of all visible and invisible worlds, and spoke:

"Master of the Universe, all-pervading Divine Self. Thou art the true Light of all beings within and without. Vishwa Deep [1] , I praise you. I am aware that in the near future, the prayers of your devotees will bear fruit, as your Divine Self will soon manifest on Earth to free them from their ignorance, suffering and pain. Your incarnation in this world will be a great blessing for all those who lead a spiritual life, as your mere existence is a message of love, truth and liberty, imparting love and understanding to all creatures.

The time has come to keep the promise that you once gave to your devotee, Vishwajita. He was a glorious king who lived in the age of satya yuga [2] . Through spiritual and intellectual discipline, love, devotion and humility Vishwajita won the hearts of many, who worshipped him as a wise and just ruler. After years of service to all, he retired from the world to live a life of solitude, meditating and praying to you."

O Supreme, you appeared before him and spoke these words: 'King, your selfless prayers are an expression of true love for all creatures. Tell me your desire and I will grant it'.

Vishwajita answered with a reverent bow, 'Lord, your eternal law is to grant the pure desire of all devotees. I have only one request: that you Yourself will incarnate once as the son of myself and Mahalakshmi [3] , the Divine Mother. May the experience of the highest consciousness, the true knowledge of atma and paramatma , descend upon me through this blessing. By your grace, I respectfully request this of you'.

And you, the Supreme, gave your promise. King Vishwajita again dwells on Earth in the form of the wise yogi , Mahant Sri Udaipuriji Maharaj and the Divine Mother Mahalakshmi is his wife, Srimati Chandan Deviji. Wise and holy men endowed with Divine sight have recognized the presence of these two divine souls among men and Divine souls who dwell in space also make their obeisance to them. Full of joy, they anticipate the moment of your incarnation on Earth.

On learning of your forthcoming incarnation, a number of devas [4] have begun to incarnate as humans so that they may also take pleasure in your Divine Play [5] , united with you in Divine Consciousness. Many of them will come to live on Earth as great bhaktas [6] and Holy men, and will attain Liberation. The others will once again return to the world of Gods."

Lord Shiva continued, "In keeping with your promise, you will soon incarnate on Earth. And, just as it is the duty of a prime minister to precede the visit of a King, I will myself first appear in order to make all necessary preparations for your arrival. Although all elements and energies are already at your disposal, I wish to be your herald to fulfil this protocol."

"Mahadeva [7] , you are the most merciful of all the Gods," OM Vishwa Deep, the Divine Self, replied, "for, unmindful of the reasons that your bhaktas pray to you, you will grant their wishes."

God Shiva responded, "You alone are the acting principle and source of all good in the world. All is well wherever you appear, your vision brings blessings to all creatures. Your Holy message serves the wellbeing of the whole world, it bears atma gyana [8] . You are God, origin of space, not even a blade of grass moves without your will. Your words alone proclaim the truth of the Universe."

[2] yuga = age or era. There are four yugas : satya yuga (golden age), treta yuga (silver age), dvapara yuga (bronze age), kali yuga (iron age). The present era is said to be kali yuga .

[4] devas = gods

[5] Divine play = (in Sanskrit) Lila - Amrit , lila = play, operation, appearance, amrit = nectar, eternal, immortal, Divine, joyful

## [The Appearance of Lord Shiva](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1485-the-appearance-of-lord-shiva)

On the night of the new moon in February, Indians celebrate the festival of Shiva-Ratri and on this night all devotees, yogis and swamis meditate until dawn. Traditional ceremonies and celebrations took place in Sri Udaipuriji's ashram . On this night dedicated to Lord Shiva, Srimati Chandan Deviji heard that numerous devotees had already been granted a vision of his Divine form.

"Maybe he will also bless me with his darshan [1] ," she mused.

She vowed to fast until blessed by Lord Shiva's appearance. In the unshakable belief that she would meet him face to face, she emerged deep into meditation and began to chant the Holy mantra ,

OM NAMAH SHIVAYA

"My Reverence to Lord Shiva"

Her devout prayer was heard and at one o'clock in the early morning hours, God Shiva appeared before her and spoke in a pure, melodious voice:

"My obeisance to you, Divine Mother! The tapasya [2] and prayers you performed in earlier lives shall now bear fruit. Grace is bestowed upon you, as you shall have the privilege of conceiving the highest Lord, king of the Universe. On the auspicious and blessed day of his incarnation in this world, the whole Universe will be filled with Divine Light. You and I will meet again, as one day I will come here to greet him. Furthermore, you will give birth to three sons and one daughter, all with pure and Holy souls."

After this, the form of God Shiva vanished and Srimati Chandan Deviji emerged from her meditation.

As her gaze once again returned to this world, she thought with consternation: "Such grace has just been showered on me! Lord Shiva himself, the Ocean of Divine Love and Wisdom, blessed me with his presence! But I was so preoccupied that I could not even present him with the proper reception!"

Full of awe, she reflected on the prophecy revealed to her and she kept wondering when and how it would happen.

This same night, Srimati Chandan Deviji had the experience of a glorious, radiant light descending upon her - filling her, body and soul. Thus she received a gift from heaven, Vishwa Deep Jyoti Paramatma [3] , the Divine Self, whose radiance illumi­nates the entire cosmos.

Nine months later, on Kartika Amavasya Deepawali [4] , called "Diwali," the Hindu Festival of Lights, Srimati Chandan Deviji had a dream at exactly 3:30am, in which she had the vision of Lord Vishnu arriving, seated on Erawat his white elephant with seven trunks [5] . In his hands Lord Vishnu held his insignias of shanka (conch shell), chakra (disc), gada (club) and padma (lotus). He was accompanied by Lord Shiva, clad in a tiger skin and riding on Nandi his bull. From his long, matted hair flowed the Ganga river (Ganges).

Half an hour after this dream on Diwali, at four a.m. — the hour of brahma muhurta [6] — on November 8, 1828 AD, the Protector of all creatures incar­nated on this Earth — Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji.

At the moment of his birth, he appeared to his mother in a vision as the Divine child Krishna, who endears himself to all. Mataji [7] Chandan Deviji realized that her son, conceived by the grace of Lord Shiva, was a Divine incarnation.

In this memorable hour several miracles occurred. The oil lamps within the village houses suddenly lit of their own accord and white flower blossoms gently fell from the sky.

On waking in the morning, the villagers were filled with an inexplicable inner joy. First, they were amazed to see the burning oil lamps and then the streets covered with white flowers. Some attributed the miracles to Lord Rama, in whose glory Diwali is celebrated. Some believed it to be the work of good spirits and others thought these miracles were performed by an invisible Divine power of the universe. No-one knew how all this had happened.

Sri Udaipuriji Maharaj, overjoyed that a Divine son had been born to him, gave gifts to the priests and the poor and reverently thanked God in his prayers.

It is a tradition in India that after the birth of a child an astrologer is summoned to cast the Horoscope and choose a suitable name. Therefore Pandit Premshankar Shastracharya, a great scholar of astrology, was consulted.

On completing his calculations, he said to Sri Udaipuriji: "This is indeed a special day! Such a planetary alignment is extremely rare and only exceptional personalities are born at such an hour. Your son will be gifted with extraordinary spiritual and supernatural powers. He is a great Soul, a Divine Master and his name shall be Deep [8] . Those who receive his Blessings will experience spiritual peace and enlightenment. This child will be like the shining Sun, not only for his family, but also for all of India and the whole world. He will be highly renowned. It is my good fortune to have been chosen to name this great Soul."



[1] darshan = vision or blessing from God or a Saint

[2] tapasya = exercise of asceticism

[3] Vishwa Deep = Universal Light, jyoti = flame, paramatma = the Supreme, Divine Self

[4] Kartika Amavasya Deepawali , or Diwali = one of the highest festivals in India and wherever Indian people live. It celebrates the day when Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after he had defeated the demon Ravana. On this day (and night) people light oil lamps and candles in their houses and windows. It is a festival of light, which conquers the darkness.

[5] The white elephant with seven trunks symbolises wealth and wisdom.

[6] brahma muhurta = hour of dawn

[7] Mataji = mother

[8] deep = light

## [Mahaprabhuji's Childhood](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1486-mahaprabhujis-childhood)



The Divine child grew and blossomed like the bud of a lotus. He emanated light like the waxing moon, much to the joy of his parents and village folk. His charm was such that the villagers didn’t allow a day to pass without seeing him. He was different from other children as he never wept. His face was always lit with the glow of a serene smile. Before he could speak, he intoned the Holy mantra OM in such a way, that all those who heard him were deeply moved.

Everyone loved to hear the sweet sound of OM from his lips. His parents and others desired for him to one day speak to them in that same melodious voice.

On the festival of Shiva-Ratri, when Lord Shiva is expected to grant the wishes of his devotees, Mahaprabhuji's parents decided to pray for the fulfilment of their desire. They prayed to Lord Shiva for the wellbeing of their son and for Shiva to grant him the faculty of speech.

Suddenly two white roses slipped from Lord Shiva's lingam [1] on the altar and fell at the feet of the parents. This was a sign to them that their prayer had been heard. Five more roses fell at the feet of Mahaprabhuji and from this moment on he spoke fluently, even though at that time he was only fifteen months of age.

Mahaprabhuji raised his face to the altar picture of Lord Shiva and chanted OM. For more than one hour he repeated this Holy mantra and then spoke in the presence of all:

SO  HAM — "I am That" Brahma  Satya  Jagat  Mithya — "God is the Truth, the world is illusion."

He went on: "This world is a confused vision, a subject of transience, full of grief, sorrow, suffering and affliction. Although apparently real, it is unreal. This unreality or ignorance is the game of maya , the power of illusion. The world is nothing but an idea, a thought. Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto this Truth and become aware of God!

“In reality, the human being is purely of a mental nature. Only due to ignorance does he consider mortal physical existence to be Reality and thus he becomes involved in the cycle of virtue and sin, joy and pain, birth and death. The world is a prison in which souls undergo affliction. Only the Satguru, the true Master, can liberate them from this bondage.

“I am the Light of the cosmos, the eternal Master. I am with form and formless, at one and the same time. Whichever path one may follow, all genuine spiritual aspirants will ultimately gain the Light of the universe. In that Light of knowledge the Truth is revealed.

"I am this Light. Only through me will my devotees experience Self-realization. I have no beginning, I am unborn and Eternal, the pure immutable witness of all existence, Omnipresent and Omniscient, beyond maya . This maya , which has hold over all creatures, is dominated by me. In every era I manifest and appear, to help devotees cross the ocean of this illusory world.

“I know all, but no-one has knowledge of me. For I am beyond speech and mind, beyond nature and attachment, beyond the three gunas [2] , beyond the five tattvas [3] and their twenty-five manifestations [4] . I am the Origin, the source of all knowledge and to recognise me is paravidya (the highest knowledge), which liberates all creatures from unreality. For me the creation of the universe is like the delightful play of a child.

“I am ever new, ever young in my Omni­potence and yet because there existed nothing before me, I am also the oldest and most ancient. It is for this reason that I often appear in the form and guise of a wise old man.

“Those bhaktas who renounce all worldly thoughts, pleasures and desires of maya , who devote themselves unto me, who meditate on me and direct their mind only to me, I shall free from all karmas and grant moksha [5] . Only by thinking of me shall they acquire the highest bliss, perfect peace and ultimate Realization.  In the end they will unite with the Supreme, that is me. You, oh great souls who have incarnated as my parents, recognize me in yourself!"

On hearing these words uttered by their son, Mahaprabhuji's parents became absorbed in that divine bliss. Diving into the depths of their own hearts, they beheld Mahaprabhuji within and in him witnessed the whole Universe - the creation, preservation and destruction of all three worlds [6] . In him they saw many forms. They shared the same experience as mother Yashoda when Krishna revealed to her the entire cosmos in his wide open mouth.

Astonished and filled with immense joy, they became submerged in the contemplation of his wonderful, Divine appearance. They bowed to Mahaprabhuji with great reverence.

"Today, our lives have been fulfilled, as we have seen the Lord with our own eyes!"

Mahaprabhuji replied: "In the age of satya yuga , through spiritual asceticism and prayer, you both requested my mercy that I incarnate as your son and grant to you God-realization by revealation of the supreme knowledge, of atma and paramatma [7] . As I promised, this has been done."

The Divine words falling from Mahaprabhuji's lips were a blessing for all mankind. His words pervaded the entire cosmos with Love and Light. Such knowledge is revealed only by those great souls who are able to awaken Universal Consciousness within themselves. This Divine secret is beyond the reach of ordinary people, who are still enveloped by ignorance, fear and anxiety.

Mahaprabhuji's words were also a great blessing for all siddhas [8] , devas , rishis , munis [9] and beings of the astral worlds. On hearing the celestial voice of Vishwa Deep, the Lord in human form, these beings experienced deep inner fulfilment, the ultimate reward for all good karmas performed in earlier lives.

Infinite mercy and bliss flow wherever Sri Mahaprabhuji directs his gaze or words. All impurity is removed and those burdened with heavy karmas are raised from the valley of grief, sorrow and pain and become liberated. To obtain the blessing of his all-blissful presence is an almost inconceivable mercy.

Whoever chants his name, is filled with infinite joy. Mahaprabhuji is the embodiment of the highest bliss and supreme happiness ( brahmananda ). His disciple, Swami Lalananda, sings in one bhajan [10] :

DHARM HETA AVATAR SATAGURU MANVE TAN DHARIYA

Mahaprabhuji, the Satguru, came to earth And accepted human form to re-establish Dharma. He chose the blessed village of Hari Vasani as the place of his incarnation, Near Khatu in the country of Marudhar [11] .

He, the Supreme, is the perfect Master And Liberator from the burden of numerous sins Proclaimed in the verses of the Vedas, the 108 Upanishads and all holy Mantras.

At the auspicious hour of dawn He was born in the house of Sri Chandan Deviji, the Holy Mother, He is Vishnu, who rests on Sheshanag, the snake of Eternity, At his side is Lord Shiva.

He reveals the Knowledge to his devotees That the name of the Satguru is the Essence of all existence, His father is Swami Sri Udaipuriji, a devotee of Lord Hari, Mahaprabhuji is the Divine incarnation in the fourth age, Kings, Gandharvas [12] and the celestial Sarda [13] proclaim his fame.

Glory to the town, the country and earth where the Lord was born! Countless are the devotees liberated from worldly sorrow by Mahaprabhuji, Lalananda, his devout disciple, now asks for his mercy

## [The Twenty-Four Siddhis](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1502-the-twenty-four-siddhis)

It is not easy for a spiritual aspirant to meet a Self-realized Master. Greater than this is to meet with the rare jewel of a Divine incarnation as mentioned above, whose mere vision is worth more than a kingdom. Although some seek their whole lives in vain, it happened in Rajasthan, India, that two such Divine incarnations lived at the same time and they were destined to meet.

## [Restoring the Life of a Young Girl](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1500-restoring-the-life-of-a-young-girl)

Another event from his youth makes it clear that Mahaprabhuji was gifted with Divine powers since childhood and that his Divine will was able to defeat even death.

One day Mahaprabhuji and his parents participated in a wedding celebration. However, an unfortunate shadow was cast over the ceremony, due to the sudden death of one of the guests, a young girl called Durga.

The funeral procession on its way to the cemetery passed by Mahaprabhuji, who was meditating under a tree. He looked up.

"Where are you taking her?"

The girl's father, weeping and distraught with grief, replied: "My daughter has died so suddenly, we are just now taking her to the cemetery for burial."

"She is not dead," Mahaprabhuji gently said. "Give her the leaves from this neem tree and she will awaken."

The grieving father requested Mahaprabhuji to give the girl the leaves with his own hands and Mahaprabhuji did so, while twice calling her name. The girl blinked opened her eyes and sat up to eat the bitter leaves. The onlookers were astonished!

It is easy to say that Mahaprabhuji brought the girl back to life, because she really had died. But how does one comprehend this incident? Of course it’s not easy to acknowledge such miracles in the world, directly or indirectly.

Omniscience and the ability to perceive all levels and worlds of the Cosmos, is within the power only of an absolute, Divine Incarnation. Mahaprabhuji sees within the hearts of man and so of course he knew where the soul of the young girl had gone.

Attempting to understand this will certainly fail within the limitations of this human world, for it is beyond the power of logic and reason. Feeding leaves from the neem tree to the girl was merely a symbolic act. It had nothing to do with the chemical properties of the leaves, rather it was due to the blessing of Mahaprabhuji that she was brought back to life.

After this miraculous event, Mahaprabhuji returned home to his family of three younger brothers, Chatur Puriji, Prem Puriji, Nanu Puriji and his sister, Mangan Deviji. Loved and respected, the children were often referred to by the villagers as the incarnations of Lord Rama and his brothers Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna.

## [Lord Hari's Incarnation in the Village of Hari Vasani](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1484-lord-haris-incarnation-in-the-village-of-hari-vasani)

Swami Sri Udaipuriji Maharaj lived in the beginning of the 19 th century as the head of Khatu Ashram at Hari Vasani, a village approximately five kilometres from Bari Khatu in the Nagore District of Rajasthan. He belonged to the Goswami order, founded by Srimat Paramyogeshwar Adi Shankar­acharya [1] .

As an exemplary karma yogi [2] , Sri Udaipuriji was ceaselessly active in the service of all creatures and was revered by others as a genuine Realized soul. His only deep longing was directed to one aim and for this he daily prayed to God:

"Lord, when will the sun of your Divine Light rise? O Supreme Self, when will you incarnate on this Earth to dispel this darkness which has descended on the world?"

Sri Udaipuriji lived in complete harmony with his wife, Srimati Chandan Deviji, a woman whose heart was full of loving-kindness, mercy and compassion. No-one who came to her door for alms or help was sent away empty-handed. Her greatest longing was to meet God and she prayed incessantly that he would help his devotees.



[1] Sri Shankaracharya lived in the 8th century AD and is the most famous expounder of Vedanta philosophy.

[2] karma = action, karma yoga = path of selfless action or work

## [The Story of a Robber](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1488-the-story-of-a-robber)

As the cows grazed, Mahaprabhuji would tend to them while sitting under a tree in meditation. However, he was always aware of whatever happened — nothing escaped his attention.

One day while Mahaprabhuji was absorbed in meditation, a robber appeared.

It ought to be mentioned that in those days there were large areas of sparsely populated land in Rajasthan. Mostly they were desolate regions of desert and in the few places of dense bush and forest, wild animals lived. The villagers avoided these places and it was common for outlaws and bandits to occupy such areas.

This robber approached the herd on his camel and drove away some cows. Mahaprabhuji, of course, was completely aware of the situation. However, he allowed the thief to finish his work without interruption and even permitted him to get some distance away. Suddenly Mahaprabhuji appeared from nowhere and stood in the robber's path.

"Release the cows and leave here immediately!" Mahaprabhuji demanded in a loud and penetrating voice.

Surprised, the robber halted in front of the small boy who fearlessly blocked his way.

"Such an attractive and courageous child!" he thought to himself. "What kind of parents would send a young boy like this all alone to the wilderness, taking such risks in tending the cows?"

But to Mahaprabhuji he retorted, "Don't be foolish, little one! No one has ever succeeded in stopping me. You are a mere child and I am twice your size. Stop delaying me and get out of my way!"

Mahaprabhuji was about nine years old at the time but he was unmoved by the robber's words.

"I have already met many who possessed far greater power than you and each of them has surrendered to me in the end. So once again I ask you, release the cows and leave!"

Without a reply, the robber spurred on his camel to continue on his way with the stolen cows, but by means of Divine powers Mahaprabhuji stopped the camel and threw the gruff fellow to the ground.

As the robber lay there unconscious, he had a vision of Mahaprabhuji's Divine form and at once realized the grave weight of his misdeeds. On regaining consciousness he reverently knelt before Mahaprabhuji and with folded hands asked forgiveness.

"Mahavir [1] , forgive my sins. I have just seen my karma and learnt the consequences of my evil deeds. I vow to steal no more and not injure anyone. Lord, please forgive me and grant me your blessing, so that I may lead an honest life henceforth."

He rode away on his camel and was never seen again. Mahaprabhuji lovingly stroked his cows and gently spoke to them as he led them back to the herd.

"Come, my dears. I am sorry you had such a scare, but since you came to no harm the man will be forgiven. He was ignorant but now has realized the Truth. Let us go home."

## [The Story of a Hunter](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1499-the-story-of-a-hunter)

Another man whose life was decisively changed, was the hunter Lal Khan, famous for his accurate marksmanship.

One day he met Mahaprabhuji, who was as usual, keeping watch over the village cows.

"Where are you going, Lal Khan?" Mahaprabhuji asked.

"Hunting," was the terse reply.

"You had better turn back," said Mahaprabhuji, "for you will bag nothing today."

Lal Khan proudly retorted, "I don't believe you, it's impossible, for I have never returned empty-handed. It may be as you say if no animal crosses before me, but as soon as one enters my sight, not even God Himself can save it from my bullet."

Mahaprabhuji pointed to a crow perched on the branch of a nearby tree, nibbling at some fruit.

"If you are really such a good marksman, prove it by hitting that crow."

Lal Khan levelled his weapon without hesitation and fired, but the shot passed by the crow, which continued to perch calmly and nibble the fruit. Lal Khan fired once more but missed again and the crow remained unmoved.

Ashamed, Lal Khan lowered his eyes to the ground before Mahaprabhuji.

"Now I realize that not even death can harm one protected by God, so how could I, a mere hunter?"

"Lal Khan, listen to what I have to tell you," Mahaprabhuji said seriously. "Every being loves its life. You cannot grant life, so you do not have the right to take life away. The law of karma says that you will suffer indescribably from the pain you have caused others. If you feel no sympathy for others, then God will not hear your prayers.

"The Divine Light exists in each creature — God dwells within the ant, the crow, the dog and deer. You kill only to satisfy your palate! For the sake of temporary pleasure you sow the seeds of pain which you are bound to reap lifetime after lifetime. God will never forgive you if you kill his children!"

This lecture coming from the lips of a child, full of Divine power and truth, made such a deep impression on Lal Khan that he gave up hunting and eating meat from that day on.

This incident was narrated to me by Lal Khan himself.

## [Searching for a Guru](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1501-searching-for-a-guru)

When Mahaprabhuji was fifteen, he knew the time had come for him to seek a Guru [1] , that spiritual Master who by tradition would initiate him in Divine blessing and knowledge [2] .

"In former times," he thought, "the wise and holy men were yogis who had full Mastery of the siddhis and possessed the power to grant blessings. The greatest siddha lives in Kailash, Lord Shiva himself, in the form of Sri Devpuriji, a perfect avadhuta [3] and sannyasi [4] . I will live under the protection of this Master."

According to sacred tradition, even Divine incarnations and Saints must seek a Master. The Guru of Lord Rama was Sri Vashista, Krishna's Master was Maharishi Sandeep.

In The Mahabharata , Lord Krishna describes the perfect Master for his friend Uddhava:

"Find a Guru who can control the body, mind and senses. Only those who have gained complete self-control can realize God the Supreme and attain all siddhis ."

Siddhis are natural milestones on the path of the yogi . Further spiritual development is parallel with  growing control over the material and spiritual worlds. As a matter of principle one should never aspire for siddhis , nor develop and use them for one's own gain. Those who possess siddhis should use them only in rare circumstances, if at all and never for selfish purposes. Any demonstration of siddhis may result in the aspirant wishing to impress others by this power. The risk in this is to be blinded by ego and pride, ultimately ending by losing sight of the original aim.

Through years of spiritual practice a yogi may eventually obtain some siddhis . However, a Divine incarnation is gifted with all twenty-four siddhis from birth. Such an incarnation stands beyond all worldly limitations.



[1] A Guru is a spiritual teacher. " gu " means darkness and " ru " means light — therefore the Guru personifies the cosmic principle that leads consciousness from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge.

[2] The cosmic principle says that paravidya , unable to be acquired through intellect, is the spiritual knowledge, mental power and Divine wisdom that can only be gained through the guidance of a Master.

[3] avadhuta = realized Saint who is completely detached from the world

[4] sannyasi = one who has renounced the world and is a swami or monk

## [Mahaprabhuji Goes to School](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1487-mahaprabhuji-goes-to-school)

During the time of British rule in India, not all villages had schools and it was extremely difficult for children to receive proper education. Pandits usually taught the children how to read and write and so at the age of five, Mahaprabhuji's parents entrusted him to a learned scholar.

The pandit took loving care of the boy and began his education by writing the first two letters of Devanagari [1] — a and á — on a slate. After explaining the pronounciation and spelling of both these vowels, he asked Mahaprabhuji to repeat them.

Mahaprabhuji looked attentively at the characters drawn on the slate and then put the following questions to the pandit . "Please tell me, which of these 'a’s' was here first? From what was the first 'a' formed and how did it develop further? What is the form of the sound of 'a' and from where does its spelling come? Why does this character stand at the beginning of the alphabet? Dear Sir, I will ask more questions after these have been answered."

The pandit was astonished to hear such words from the lips of a child.

"According to our grammar the letters are usually arranged, written and pronounced in this way. I can’t say anything more."

"Dear Sir," Mahaprabhuji replied, "will you allow me to give an explanation?"

Then with deep wisdom he revealed the secret of the creation, preser­vation and destruction of the Cosmos. He explained our attach­­ment to the process of nature, which has its origin in the three godheads (Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh or Shiva), the three gunas ( sattva , rajas and tamas ) and the three chronological dimen­sions (of past, present and future). He described how the sound of "a" (which is composed of the three matras [2] ) contains all of this.

The pandit felt his inner Self filled with an indescribable bliss and tears of joy filled his eyes. He bowed to Mahaprabhuji.

"O Ocean of Mercy, the true knowledge of Brahman has been revealed to me today, by you. You have made me infinitely happy. Lord, please bless me not only in this life, but also in the lives to come. You are the inscrutable Ocean of Knowledge and God Reality. You have come to earth to teach Truth to mankind, you are the redeemer, the benefactor of humanity, unique in all the three worlds. You are the true unparalleled Master before whom all learning of this world is worthless. You have given, in a moment, the richness of this world to your devotee. O Lord, I have studied the Vedas, Vedanta, Sanskrit, Vyakaran [3] , Tarka Shastra [4] and other sciences. I have read numerous religious texts and was superior in discourses of shastra [5] over other great scholars. At your feet I worship you.

"My ego, the fruit of maya and of learning, has melted as a result of the all-illuminating ray of your words, saturated with nectar. Now I have become fearless and have achieved equani­mity. Never before have I experienced such bliss. Out of ignorance I considered myself as enlightened, but in reality, I was a slave to ignorance and sensuality. Though I used to treat these as natural to the spirit and senses, I now see myself as the untouched witness of this drama. Ego and pride blinded me and darkened my soul, I considered myself an authority — what a great mistake! For today I have learned the Truth!

"O my Master, the Supreme! The most precious gift in the three worlds is Self-realization, which I have received from you today."

Mahaprabhuji answered, "Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto this Truth and remember the Lord."

The other students present in class were equally surprised at Mahaprabhuji's wisdom.

"Lord, grant this knowledge to us," they entreated. "Relieve us from the burden of ignorance and accept us as your disciples. Make us and all human beings, followers of Truth, O Protector of dharma !"

Mahaprabhuji complied with their sincere wishes.

"My dear fellow students, a disciple leads a life of discipline and severity. Learning is nothing other than asceticism. One who makes the effort moves on, towards an infinitely better future. Students should make it their duty to serve the community, their country and all mankind. The highest dharma is service to all creatures. God Himself weighed the significance of moksha (liberation) and seva (service) and found seva to be more important than moksha . He therefore renounced the absolute bliss of liberation and incarnated 24 times on earth to serve and help the needy. Just as the sun, moon, earth, water, air and fire are in service to others, so too the only aim of my life is to serve the Universe. Service is the purpose of every human life.

"Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus and all the Saints were students like you in their childhood. They became great by virtue of their studies. Through true Knowledge, avidya [6] is dispelled. Take the following rules to heart:

The students listened atttentively to Mahaprabhuji's words. Gratefully accepting his teachings, they promised to follow the path he had revealed to them.

Mahaprabhuji then respectfully bowed to the pandit . "You say there is nothing for me to learn here, therefore I will return to my home and keep watch over the cows of the village. It is a great honour to be the servant of the cows - they yield to us their milk, just as our mothers do."

With this, Mahaprabhuji bid them farewell and returned to his parents in Hari Vasani.

Every day he drove the cows to pasture and he had a unique method for watching over them.

At the break of dawn, Mahaprabhuji would walk to the outer limits of the village, sit down in lotus posture and chant OM in a loud, melodious voice. Attracted by this beautiful sound, all cows of the village would soon gather around him and what an incredible sight followed! The cows lovingly licked his feet and Mahaprabhuji would stroke them and shower them with an all-embracing love.

He would then leave the village and the cows would follow. On their way to pasture the cows never touched the village crops, they obediently grazed only in those fields indicated by Mahaprabhuji. At times it did happen that a few strays remained behind in the field and some tender stalks would fall victim to their hunger.

The farmers of those fields would complain to Mahaprabhuji about the loss of their crops, but with a gentle smile Mahaprabhuji would only ask the farmers of the estimated damage. On hearing their replies, Mahaprabhuji would laugh and assure them that despite the apparent damage, they could expect a greater yield than anticipated. If not, then he Mahaprabhuji, would make up for that loss. But the yield in such fields was always better than expected and the farmers marvelled at such incidents. They would say that Mahaprabhuji was Narayan, Lord Vishnu himself.

Thereafter, each farmer hoped that Mahaprabhuji might choose their field as pasture for the cows. But Mahaprabhuji acted according to his own Divine will and only entered those fields that he chose for the cows.

## [God's Promise](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/1483-gods-promise)

Lord Shiva was engrossed in deep contemplation of that which is eternal, Divine, all-embracing and beyond time and space. While he was in this state of cosmic consciousness, the Divine Self appeared before him in his highest manifestation of eternal brilliance: the light and sound of OM.

Becoming aware of his presence, Lord Shiva opened his eyes and bowed with reverence to the Supreme, the source of all visible and invisible worlds, and spoke:

"Master of the Universe, all-pervading Divine Self. Thou art the true Light of all beings within and without. Vishwa Deep [1] , I praise you. I am aware that in the near future, the prayers of your devotees will bear fruit, as your Divine Self will soon manifest on Earth to free them from their ignorance, suffering and pain. Your incarnation in this world will be a great blessing for all those who lead a spiritual life, as your mere existence is a message of love, truth and liberty, imparting love and understanding to all creatures.

The time has come to keep the promise that you once gave to your devotee, Vishwajita. He was a glorious king who lived in the age of satya yuga [2] . Through spiritual and intellectual discipline, love, devotion and humility Vishwajita won the hearts of many, who worshipped him as a wise and just ruler. After years of service to all, he retired from the world to live a life of solitude, meditating and praying to you."

O Supreme, you appeared before him and spoke these words: 'King, your selfless prayers are an expression of true love for all creatures. Tell me your desire and I will grant it'.

Vishwajita answered with a reverent bow, 'Lord, your eternal law is to grant the pure desire of all devotees. I have only one request: that you Yourself will incarnate once as the son of myself and Mahalakshmi [3] , the Divine Mother. May the experience of the highest consciousness, the true knowledge of atma and paramatma , descend upon me through this blessing. By your grace, I respectfully request this of you'.

And you, the Supreme, gave your promise. King Vishwajita again dwells on Earth in the form of the wise yogi , Mahant Sri Udaipuriji Maharaj and the Divine Mother Mahalakshmi is his wife, Srimati Chandan Deviji. Wise and holy men endowed with Divine sight have recognized the presence of these two divine souls among men and Divine souls who dwell in space also make their obeisance to them. Full of joy, they anticipate the moment of your incarnation on Earth.

On learning of your forthcoming incarnation, a number of devas [4] have begun to incarnate as humans so that they may also take pleasure in your Divine Play [5] , united with you in Divine Consciousness. Many of them will come to live on Earth as great bhaktas [6] and Holy men, and will attain Liberation. The others will once again return to the world of Gods."

Lord Shiva continued, "In keeping with your promise, you will soon incarnate on Earth. And, just as it is the duty of a prime minister to precede the visit of a King, I will myself first appear in order to make all necessary preparations for your arrival. Although all elements and energies are already at your disposal, I wish to be your herald to fulfil this protocol."

"Mahadeva [7] , you are the most merciful of all the Gods," OM Vishwa Deep, the Divine Self, replied, "for, unmindful of the reasons that your bhaktas pray to you, you will grant their wishes."

God Shiva responded, "You alone are the acting principle and source of all good in the world. All is well wherever you appear, your vision brings blessings to all creatures. Your Holy message serves the wellbeing of the whole world, it bears atma gyana [8] . You are God, origin of space, not even a blade of grass moves without your will. Your words alone proclaim the truth of the Universe."

## [The Divine Master](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1504-the-divine-master)

In the middle of the inaccessible mountain range of Sambu Panca Atala Akhara, there dwells the Omnipresent Supreme Brahman in the form of the hermit ascetic, Sri Alakh Puriji Maharaj [1] . Lord Shiva of Kailash [2] went to meet him at Badrinath-Dhama in the Himalayas. This meeting of both Divine manifestations was a blessing for the whole universe.

In order to rescue and liberate souls from the illusion of maya , Lord Shiva wished to embody himself in human form. Adhering to sacred law, he sought the consent of his Guru , Sri Alakh Puriji.

"Brahman himself you are, Lord of the Cosmos," Lord Shiva said to him. "I worship you as my Guru ."

The great yogi blessed him.

"Shiva you are, the Supreme, Omniscient and all-powerful. From this day forth, you shall be known as Sri Devpuriji Maharaj."

Sri Devpuriji settled in the Abu Mountains of South Rajasthan, where he lived for some time in silence as a Sannyasi, unknown to those around him.



[1] Siddha-Dham or Siddha Dhuni is located between the towns of pilgrimage Kedarnath and Badrinath in the Himalayas. Sri Alakh Puriji stayed there from time to time with some disciples. He is one of the great rishis or siddhas of the satya loka , the supreme cosmic sphere of pure Truth and Reality. The real meaning of alakh is "indescribable." Sri Devpuriji is the personification of Lord Shiva, who is the liberator and destroyer of all evils. Shiva is consciousness, awareness, purity and fire. He protects his devotees.

Lord Shiva is the first exponent of yoga and he revealed this knowledge to Parvati, thereby bestowing a great gift on the whole world. The bhakta (devotee) who meditates on Lord Shiva obtains liberation in the shortest way, for Lord Shiva is the most kind and merciful of the three Divine Godheads. Brahma is the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva (or Mahesh) is the Destroyer and Liberator. To most people these Divine principles are different aspects of the one Reality, Vishwa Deep, the One Universal Light, but in reality, all three are One.

[2] Kailash Mountain of the Himalayas (now under Chinese rule in Tibet) is the holy abode of Lord Shiva.

## [The First Miracle](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1505-the-first-miracle)

At a military post of the British Government at Mount Abu there was a duty officer who had always been quite hostile to the Hindus. It was here that Sri Devpuriji first appeared in public.

One evening when the British officer was strolling by Lake Nakki, he happened to pass the temple of Sri Duleshwar Shiva at the time of prayer when the sound of songs, drums, bells and cymbals resonated from the temple. As this officer detested the exotic sounds of Indian worship, he angrily entered the temple and interrupted the prayer.

"Why do you make such unbearable noise?" he barked at the priests. "Your God must be either deaf or asleep if you need to make so much noise to wake him. You disturb the peace of the entire area, therefore I order that this spectacle come to an end at once! If your God really wants to hear such music, he should seek my permission. Whoever violates this order to play any instrument without my personal approval, shall be arrested!"

With a view to make them realize that he meant what he said, he immediately took into custody a few of the brahmins [1] .

The priests and sadhus [2] were rightly afraid that this was the end of their freedom to practise their own religion, but knew it was not wise to defy the British officer. In despair they began to fast - praying night and day to Lord Shiva, so that he might appear to make the officer rescind his order and release the brahmins .

The British officer came to know of the activities and prayers of the Hindus and decided to poison the sadhus . For this purpose he obtained bottles of nitric acid and had them brought to his house.

During those days Sri Devpuriji was living a life of seclusion in dense forests of the Mount Abu range. Only rarely did someone glimpse him tending his cows. Otherwise he remained virtually unnoticed. His transcendent and all-embracing awareness heard the distressed calls of the sadhus and priests, so in order to help his devotees, he decided to reveal the presence of Lord Shiva himself to the tyrannical British officer.

Proceeding to this man’s house, loudly and clearly he shouted, "Englishman, come out! Here is a sadhu who has come to drink the poison you have prepared for the Hindu priests and brahmins ."

The officer heard Sri Devpuriji and was alarmed at this unusual request, for how could anyone know that he had such poison? Assuming that the fearless swami was leader of the rebellious priests, he commanded a servant to bring a bottle of the acid.

Sri Devpuriji drank the poison, emptying the bottle in one draught, but it had no effect.

"As you can see, I am still alive!" he said to the officer. "Do you have more such bottles? If so, then bring them here!"

Six more bottles were brought and Sri Devpuriji drank them all, one after the other. The officer and all present stood in speechless in amazement, unable to believe their eyes. Finally, Sri Devpuriji shattered all seven bottles and swallowed the glass. He then lay on the ground and withdrew his breath to the brahma randhra [3] , whereupon his pulse became imperceptible. The relieved officer concluded that the poison had finally taken effect and the impertinent swami was now dead.

He called servants to carry away the lifeless body, but just at that moment Sri Devpuriji sat up and smiled.

"What do you think? I am still very much alive and was only taking a little rest!"

Then he appeared in his true Divine form and grabbing the frightened officer, carried him bodily to the banks of Lake Nakki. Sri Devpuriji walked out over the water of the lake as if it were dry land and on reaching the deepest point, he stopped and spoke to the wretched officer.

"As I have heard, you too have some requests to make of Lord Shiva. Now you have the opportunity to express them personally, as he truly stands before you!"

Trembling with fear, the officer began to pray, "Sri Devapurisa Mahadeva, rescue me!"

He recited this mantra five times and Sri Devpuriji graciously nodded to him.

"You have found the right words. This mantra will most certainly save you from the world that you know, from this ocean of suffering and pain."

Encouraged by these compassionate words of Sri Devpuriji, the officer continued to repeat the mantra and was permitted to touch the lotus hands of the Divine Master. Instantly he was purified. There was a great change in him and his mind was filled with Divine richness.

With folded hands he begged for Sri Devpuriji's blessing.

"Lord, grant us your mercy. We of the Western world possess education, science and art. We have money and food in abundance yet we lack true yoga - wisdom, knowledge of God and inner peace. Therefore I request that you bless us with your presence and grant us your wisdom and mercy."

Sri Devpuriji always satisfies the pure wish of his devotees and so he replied, "Your desire will be fulfilled."

He prophesied that God Himself would appear on this earth in the form of Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji.

"A great and luminous soul from satya loka will be sent to spread the message of peace and the Divine teachings of Vishwa Deep throughout the whole world. I myself, in the form of blessing and light, will always accompany him. The radiance of Vishwa Deep, the universal Divine Light, fills the entire cosmos. This messenger to come is part of him and all who are devoted to him shall be liberated from ignorance and delusion and will attain enlightenment and inner peace."

After Sri Devpuriji had bestowed his blessing and made this prophecy to the officer, he delivered him safely to the shore. Immediately the officer ordered the release of the brahmins and priests, begged their forgiveness for his errant ways and showered them with gifts. In the meantime, thousands of faithful devotees had gathered around the shores of Lake Nakki. Overjoyed at the sight of him, they all praised Shiva, Lord of Kailash. Everyone tried to get closer to Yogiraj [4] Sri Devpuriji, but he vanished as suddenly as he had appeared.

The news of this miracle quickly spread and the people felt assured that benevolent God Shiva had heard their prayers and was sending them a Divine protector, just as was prophesied. Materially poor Indian people may be, but they are rich in spirituality, their faith in God is strong. Regardless of poverty, in their faith they are certain that God watches over everything and that in His inexhaustible mercy, He sends them His help.

This story was told to me by the old sadhus and brahmins of Mount Abu, as well as by Mahaprabhuji himself.



[1] brahmin = One of the four castes in India. Brahmins are those contemplativc persons who have full knowledge of the Vedas and Vedic philosophy and who are spiritually inspired.

[2] sadhu = a hermit devoted to asceticism and spiritual discipline

[3] brahma randhra = sahasrar , seventh chakra

[4] Yogiraj = "King of the Yogis", an epithet for Lord Shiva

## [Nath Babaji](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1508-nath-babaji)

In a hut behind the ashram there once lived a man called Nath Babaji. The Naths are a sect that worship Devi, the Divine Mother Goddess. These followers wear long earrings and armlets made of copper and glass.

Nath Babaji was performing a nine-day ceremonial exercise in honour of Devi, called Navrati. This ritual symbolises the nine-day fight of the Mother Goddess against the forces of evil, which appear in nine different forms. Nath Babaji was sitting in front of a stone statue of the Devi and carrying out the prescribed prayers when Sri Devpuriji suddenly entered his hut and stood watching him.

"Nath Babaji," Sri Devpuriji finally said, "you have pierced and opened your ear lobes to decorate yourself with rings. It would be better to open your spirit and release it from the illusion of maya . What can you expect from a figure of stone? Think of those who are useful in life: a king, a doctor and teacher. The king can make you a lord if he chooses, but only as long as he is alive. When you are ill you can expect a cure from a doctor, but only if he lives. Likewise, only a living teacher can impart knowledge. So why do you worship a lifeless image that can never give you anything?"

Nath Babaji was upset at the abrupt disturbance of his worship and annoyed by Sri Devpuriji's words, but he dared not reply. Instead he bowed his head and left the hut without a word. He told no-one where he was going.

Three days later, through the siddhi of prakashya [1] , Sri Devpuriji saw that Nath Babaji was staying in Lohagal, a place of pilgrimage in the Sikar district. Here he was taking part in a religious celebration. In his heart Nath Babaji was troubled because he had not been able to control his feelings when Sri Devpuriji had confronted him.

The all-recognizing Sri Devpuriji appeared and spoke to Nath Babaji in a comforting tone.

"Stop worrying! You are my disciple and wherever you are, I am with you. Whenever you think of me, I will come to you."

At these merciful words from his Master, tears of joy flowed from Nath Babaji's eyes and he fell at Sri Devpuriji's feet. When he looked up again Sri Devpuriji had disappeared.

In this way Nath Babaji was given the blessing of Sri Devpuriji, which led him from  blind and naive belief in images and ritual, to the path of Divine Truth. From this time onward he become a devout follower of Gurudeva [2] .



[1] prakashya siddhi = ability to see all places in the universe

[2] Gurudeva = the Guru seen as God

## [Control of the Elements](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1509-control-of-the-elements)

Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji continued to live in retreat in Kailash. Usually he preferred the company of animals to that of people.

In our current age of kali yuga , the iron age, people have become so selfish and greedy, so possessed by the delusion of the ego, that God retires from our midst. And if people want to keep their hearts locked, no power in the universe is able to open them.

Animals, however, gratefully accepted Sri Devpuriji's love and were devoted to him. Always there were cows, dogs, sheep, snakes, goats and a great number of birds in his presence. These animals lived together harmoniously in the ashram . Lovingly, Sri Devpuriji cared for them and shared his food with them. He spoke to them because he understood that universal language which is beyond words.

Among these animals was one thoroughbred horse and being an excellent rider, Sri Devpuriji often performed tricks on the back of the horse. Sometimes while galloping, he hid himself under the horse so that it appeared as if the horse had no rider. The farmers would try to catch the horse and then Sri Devpuriji would suddenly appear in the saddle. Often he sent this horse to graze in a particular pasture, with orders when it should return. The horse understood and perfectly obeyed all instructions.

One day some visitors came to the ashram and were reluctant to enter, being afraid of the animals roaming about. However, they finally gathered their courage and went in. Respectfully they greeted Sri Devpuriji and expressed the question they had come to ask.

"Swamiji, we have come to ask if it is really possible to control the elements. We have heard that neither air, water nor ether can withstand the will and command of a perfect yogi ."

Instead of giving an explanation, Sri Devpuriji took a blanket and laid it on the back of one of his dogs. He then completely soaked the blanket with kerosene and set it alight. To the horror of the visitors the flames leapt high and they believed that the crazy swami had set the innocent creature alight. But the dog stood calmly, feeling nothing. Finally the blanket was completely burnt out, yet not a single hair of the dog was singed.

Sri Devpuriji would meditate not only at Kailash Ashram but also in the hills of Khatu, in the middle of the jungle, under an indrok tree, or on the banks of the watering place in Kailash. He went wherever his Divine will took him. Even the elements submitted to his Divine nature. No matter how hard it rained, Sri Devpuriji always remained dry, for within a radius of four metres around him, not a single drop fell. Of course those who saw this wanted to know how such things were possible.

"Indra, the god of rain, or the element of water, whatever you wish to call it, responds to my command," he told them.

One of his neighbours was the farmer Gangaram. Once when it was pouring with rain Sri Devpuriji went to Gangaram's house holding a burning cowpat.

"Look, Gangaram," he shouted in jest to the farmer, "even Lord Indra is unable to cool my cowpat. This rain is as warm as the midday sun!"

Quite moved, Gangaram replied, "You are truly the Ocean of Mercy. Nobody under your protection can ever be harmed."

And Sri Devpuriji said to him, "You are a great soul, Gangaram. Now you have begun to understand the play of Gurudeva."

And this was Sri Devpuriji, like a child and wise man at the same time. The motive for his actions often exceeded human understanding.

While recording the events of the life of this Divine Master, I often find myself hesitating and thinking how diverse are the ways in which people think. How differently these stories may be received and interpreted. Some believe in miracles but others not. Many who read this for the first time may find it impossible to take seriously.

Unfortunately my Divine Master Mahaprabhuji has already left this world, for I wish everybody could have the same experiences I was blessed with.

It is not my intention to narrow-mindedly insist that my Guru is the only true Guru , or prove that my religion is the only right religion. Rather I wish, simply and exactly, to report the miracles of my Divine Master, Sri Mahaprabhuji and those of his Satguru, Sri Devpuriji. I hope and trust my deep conviction speaks for itself.

In India we are taught to worship all Saints wherever they live, regardless of cult or religion. Holiness and spirituality recognise no difference and know no measure of space or time. Enlightenment transcends all human conditions and is present anywhere and everywhere, as that One Divine principle. The miracles and wonders of this one principle are diversely revealed, in accord with the nature of this world. God is the power of Divine Consciousness, Omnipresent like the sky above the earth.

Great and holy souls have always incarnated on earth but in different places at different times. Moses, Jesus, Confucius, Mohammed and Buddha are known to many. Others are only known to their disciples. India is spiritually an important place because such Divine incarnations occur in greater number here than elsewhere.

Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Sri Devpuriji, Sri Mahaprabhuji and numerous great yogis and Saints such as Vivekananda, Shivananda, Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharishi, Mirabai, Sant Tukaran, Sant Gyaneshwar, Swami Samartha Ram Dassji, Kabirdas, Surdas and many others have incarnated in this country.

It is impossible to give an account of the lives of all these Saints but it is certain that each Divine soul possessed perfect Mastery over nature and control of the elements. Thus no destructive power could harm them or those under their protection. All Saints emanate pure love and compassion for all creatures, their lives give guidance and relief to the whole world.

## [Kailash Ashram](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1507-kailash-ashram)

From this time on, Sri Devpuriji appeared in public more often. He left the Abu Mountains and first went to Nasirabad, near Ajmer in Rajasthan. Here also there was a post of the British military. The British officers who came to know him were deeply impressed by him.

From Nasirabad he travelled to Kailash village in the Sikar district of Rajasthan. Here he told the inhabitants that he wanted to build an ashram . As Sri Devpuriji was by now well known to the people of this region, they recognised the great fortune of having him live near them and hearing his sermons. Therefore they were willing to do anything for him and soon built a beautiful two-storey building to serve as an ashram .

Kailash Ashram is situated on a small hill in the desert. From it one has a sweeping view of majestic sunrises and sunsets. To the north one can see ponds and a river and behind the river is an avenue of trees. In the opposite direction, several kilometres away, sits the village of Kailash. With the farmers' huts of thatched straw in shades of soft browns and greys, the scene resembles a pastel painting. A long valley opens out to the west and in the distance is a semicircle of rugged brown hills.

The ashram is constructed very simply. The basic material is whitewashed stone. Both levels have open terraces and large banyan trees give shade to the building. According to Vedic tradition, in the centre of the ashram is a havana kunda [1] . The whole building is an ideal place for yogis and meditators. The air is clean and pure and one can gaze, unhindered, far into the distance.

In this new ashram Sri Devpuriji began to give lectures on The Ramayana , the great epic poem of Sri Goswami Tulsidas. News quickly spread of the wonderful satsangs [2] and soon many more listeners came. To reach the ashram they travelled, by foot, oxcart and camel, long distances through the desert.

The journeys of these people lent a picturesque sight to the desert. Not for nothing is Rajasthan called, "the land of colours." The men wear yellow, red or pink turbans, the women wear long coloured saris and skirts of hand-printed fabric in brilliant colours. At work in the field the farmers' wives look like flocks of lively, exotic birds in the rich green pastures.

After sunset, campfires before the ashram became a common sight. Accompanied by the rhythm of instruments, the villagers came and left the day behind them as they gathered in satsang . Here on the edge of the desert under a clear night sky, it seemed as if peace had descended upon the whole land.

Every day Sri Devpuriji preached in the ashram and his words were like heavenly nectar for the listeners. There was always enough food and drink. Prasad [3] was generously distributed and the question was not whether there was enough, but rather, "Where did all this come from?"

No-one was ever seen buying food for the ashram and no deliveries were ever made. It is known that Lakshmi, the Goddess of Fortune and Kubera, the god of prosperity, are at the service of siddhas and people were convinced that it was these Divine helpers who provided for the ashram .

The following story was told to me by a villager who is still living in Kailash.

One day he came to Sri Devpuriji in great despair because he lacked money to meet even his most basic needs. Sri Devpuriji lifted up one corner of the blanket on which he was sitting and revealed a great quantity of British coins. Sri Devpuriji allowed the poor villager, who was quite astonished, to take as much as he needed.

As many other devotees had similar experiences, the impression grew that Sri Devpuriji kept a large sum of money hidden under his blanket. One day, just after giving some coins away, Sri Devpuriji left the room and in his absence, someone seized with curiosity lifted Sri Devpuriji's blanket to see how much money was really hidden underneath. But nothing was there, only bare floor.

Each day many wonderful things happen around a Saint.

For more than three years Sri Devpuriji preached daily, but gradually it became the villagers' habit to visit the ashram merely to enjoy the pleasant atmosphere and the good food. Not one among them practised yoga or seriously tried to incorporate the teachings into their daily life.

When Sri Devpuriji realized that he was wasting his time, he decided to stop the satsangs .

One day when everyone had gathered, he suddenly called out, "Quick, leave the ashram ! The top floor is falling down!"

The building was new and solidly built, so no-one believed that it could fall apart. But under the penetrating gaze of Sri Devpuriji the top floor cracked, swayed and splintered and the walls crashed down. As quickly as they were able, the people fled from the ashram . Miraculously no-one was hurt.

But that wasn't all. Sri Devpuriji let out a strange hum which lured snakes [4] from all directions and he did not cease until the last of the visitors ran away.

For a long time the villagers spoke about this frightening episode, but they could find no explanation for Sri Devpuriji's actions. Most thought he had gone mad and very few attempted to discover the real reason for what had happened.

And so Sri Devpuriji ended his public sermons. From that time on, he only spoke to those individuals whose paths, in one way or another crossed his, or to those who came to him for help.

Today, Kailash Ashram has been extended. It now has a large hall for meditation and a plaque commemorating Sri Devpuriji. However, the older part of the building remains unchanged since the moment of its collapse. The fallen stones have long ago been removed, but if you climb to the roof it is possible to recognise the former wall of the top floor.



[1] havana kunda = fireplace

[2] sat = truth, sanga = gathering, society. Satsang is a ceremonial celebration and meeting in the service of Truth

[3] prasad = food blessed by God, such as nuts, fruit and sweets. It is distributed after prayer during the satsang .

[4] Snakes belong to Lord Shiva. Once when he lived in the jungle, snakes crawled over his body while he sat in mediation. Snakes are also messengers of change.

## [The Snake Charmers](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1514-the-snake-charmers)

Everyone has surely heard of the many snake charmers in India, who travel from village to village and set up camp in the surrounding areas to display their skill. Of course they must be very skilful to trap and train the snakes and to protect themselves from a fatal bite.

In snake charming, as in all trades, there can be found the wise and respected, but also the swindlers and charlatans. There was once a leader of these snake charmers who unfortunately had directed all his energies into the development of negative powers. He had perfected the ability to render people unconscious by virtue of his hypnotic stare. His favourite victims in this game, were sadhus and swamis .

As he learned of the reputation of Sri Devpuriji and his many snakes, he became curious to discover more. So sending two of his fellow snake charmers to test Sri Devpuriji, he decided to find out what kind of person this yogi was.

With pretence and flattery they came to Sri Devpuriji.

"Sir, we have come to show you our modest art."

Sri Devpuriji allowed the two charlatans to begin their magic flute-playing. Their efforts had no effect, Sri Devpuriji's snakes were not at all aroused. They didn’t move an inch! After several more unsuccessful attempts, the rogues angrily turned on Sri Devpuriji.

"You have bewitched these snakes! Your magic spells may be superior to ours, but you will surely not influence our Master who is much more powerful than us. You will be no match for him!"

And so they escorted Sri Devpuriji to their camp, where he might measure his powers against those of their Master. All those belonging to the troupe of snake charmers, gathered in anticipation to watch.

The Master snake charmer summoned all his power and fixed a stony glare upon Sri Devpuriji. For a long time he stared but nothing happened. In vain did he try to defeat Sri Devpuriji, just as he had defeated so many others before. Finally, Sri Devpuriji returned the snake charmer’s stare and the man suddenly fell down unconscious. Sri Devpuriji first looked into the faces of the astonished bystanders and then spoke to the stunned snake charmer.

"I have just proven that your powers are not as great as you thought. In your own camp, before your own people I have defeated you. This was not done to display my own power, but rather to teach you an invaluable lesson about ignorance and pride. You have imagined yourself to be the highest possible authority, but this is the most grave mistake a man can make. By doing this you have placed yourself under the tyranny of your ego and thus yourself have become a tyrant. Instead of wasting time inflicting shameful defeats on sadhus and swamis you had best Master your own ego. The only power of any value comes by the grace of God who works through you and the only meaningful victory to be had, is the one over your own negative qualities."

Humbly the snake charmer bowed to Sri Devpuriji.

"O merciful one, with your blessing I will completely change my behaviour."

The details of this event soon spread throughout the community of the snake charmers and ever since they have worshipped Sri Devpuriji as their patron Saint. Today they still bring their sons to Kailash Ashram to receive blessing before initiation into the art of snake charming.

## [The Wild Aghoris](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1506-the-wild-aghoris)

The hills of Mount Abu were then full of danger and still are in some places today. There were bears, wolves, leopards, tigers and uncivilised tribes, some of whom were part cannibal.

Once Sri Devpuriji had taken the form of a small boy and walking through these remote areas, he came to a cave where there lived four savages of the Aghori tribe. On seeing the strong boy, a wild joy arose in them as they anticipated a tasty meal.

Sri Devpuriji paused in front of their cave and feigning innocence, addressed the Aghoris.

"I have heard that you are peaceful and devout people, certainly you would be kind to a child."

But a scornful reply came from the men.

"Devout and good! Don't make us laugh. We will immediately catch you and eat you."

Sri Devpuriji, still in the form of a child, laughed at them and retorted, "You cannot catch me."

"Who do you think you are?" one angered Aghori cried. "You behave as if you are like God Rama?"

He lunged at the child and tried to grab him, but missed. The boy suddenly appeared on the opposite side of the cave and there was nothing childlike now in his gaze. Rather his eyes held an all-consuming and powerful expression.

"Yes, I am God. What do you have to say now?"

The Aghoris were astonished but they were not yet convinced. They decided to test the child.

"When the rocks, trees and mountains call the name of Lord Rama, then we shall believe you."

With this, Sri Devpuriji the boy turned and shouted a command, "Mountains, rocks and trees, let me hear the name of Lord Rama."

Three times the overwhelming voice of nature rang out with the call, " RAM, RAM, RAM !"

At this the Aghoris realized God had indeed manifested in this small child and had come to purify them of their sins. For this mercy they gratefully bowed to Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji, who once again adopted his usual appearance and the Aghoris worshipped him as their Master.

He spoke severely to them.

"So many serious sins have you committed that you yourself have become sin! Your future is wrapped in darkness and your karmas are loaded with the tears and fears of those you have harmed. A human life is not permitted to be lived like this! You came to this world to do good for others and yourselves. Waste your lives no longer and begin fulfilling the purpose of your human birth. Live for the benefit of humanity and purify your karmas ."

In their repentance the Aghoris could only say, "O God, what kind fate has led you to us today! None but you can show us the right path."

But Sri Devpuriji admonished them further.

"From today you will renounce your terrible customs, including killing your fellow man. You have thoroughly poisoned the atmosphere here, therefore leave this place immediately and retreat to the Ginar Mountains. There you will find an isolated cave which is holy and pure. Your future lies in this cave, where you shall practise sense withdrawal from the world and concentrate and meditate on the sacred syllable OM. Thus you will find inner peace."

Blessing them, he gave each one a mantra and revealed the meaning of OM. Then, with the use of laghima siddhi [1] , Sri Devpuriji left them.

The Aghoris faithfully followed his command. Repeating their mantra and forsaking their former habits, they became great and devout yogis .

## [Raising the Dead](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1510-raising-the-dead)

In Kailash, the Mina family was celebrating the marriage of their daughter, Vija Rams. Suddenly, during the joyous festivities, a girl called Kheti Bai fell ill and died. Her family was fortunate that Sri Devpuriji was staying in the village at this time.

Believing in his Divine powers, they carried her to him in the hope of being blessed by his compassion. Laying her at his feet they begged for his mercy.

Sri Devpuriji looked at the girl.

"She is not dead. I tell you that she will be restored to good health and become a loving and pious mother. Now, my daughter, wake up from your meditation!"

Kheti Bai opened her eyes and smiled at her benefactor.

She lives today with her husband in Sri Madhopur village in the Sikar district of Rajasthan.

A similar miracle happened in nearby Jalunda village to the noble family of Rajput Sri Balu Singhji. One evening Balu Singhji's son died and the mourning family carried his dead body to the ashram of Sri Devpuriji to plead for his mercy.

It was after midnight when they reached the ashram and Sri Devpuriji angrily shouted at them, "This is no cemetery, go away! You are miserable and selfish and come only when you have problems!"

But all knew that Sri Devpuriji's words were only a test of their devotion and patiently they waited for his mood to become calm. Their belief was rewarded, for some time later Sri Devpuriji came out of the ashram . He instructed them to bring wood from three different villages and light a fire. When they had done as he instructed, he took the blanket covering the boy and tore it in half. He placed one piece over the child and handed the other to the mother.

"Take this cloth and tie it around a branch of that tree over there."

The mother ran and with trembling hands tied a knot around a branch. As she pulled the ends of the cloth tight the child opened his eyes and began to breathe.

How should I describe such a Divine personality who stands beyond all earthly matters? How can the human mind pass judgement in the face of this reality? I can only see the realized One, the Omnipotent himself in Sri Devpuriji. Call him a Saint, a yogi , a Master or God, but is not that one who gives life Master over everything?

Many people still living today, have been witness to Sri Devpuriji raising animals from death. I would like to recount two such instances here.

In the village of Kachras near Khatu, one man's beautiful black sheep died and he was preparing to dispose of it when Sri Devpuriji came into the village.

"Where do you carry this sheep?" he shouted from afar.

"It is dead and we take it to be skinned," was the reply.

"No, no, it’s not dead!" Sri Devpuriji said. "It is only ill, bring it to me and I will heal it."

When the sheep had been taken to him, he ordered them to fetch some water which he then sprinkled over the dead animal. Immediately it opened its eyes and stood up. To the great surprise of all, the creature was obviously in good health.

Sri Devpuriji asked the owner of the sheep if he could keep it and of course, the man considered himself fortunate for the opportunity of making a gift to the Saint. For the remainder of its life the sheep stayed with Sri Devpuriji, providing him her milk and following him wherever he went.

Sri Devpuriji later told some close devotees that this particular sheep had been the wife of a rich man in a former incarnation. Spoiled by a luxurious life, she had not followed Guru vakya (she had disobeyed the instructions of her Master). The karmic consequence of such conduct was that she was reborn as a sheep. Due to other good karmas however, she had the fortune to live with her Divine Master.

While I was busy writing this book a stranger came to me and offered to put the treasure of his experience at my disposal. He told me that previously he had been a hunter, earning a living by killing birds. This is his story:

"One day I was on my way home with a basket full of dead birds when suddenly, I saw Sri Devpuriji approaching me. I was afraid that he would wish to know what was inside the basket and so I tried to hide it, but could find no place where it could be concealed.

"The Omnipotent protector and liberator of all souls caught sight of me and just as I feared, he asked, 'What do you have in your basket'?

"I broke out in a sweat for it finally dawned on me the terrible burden and responsibility of having destroyed the lives of all those little birds."

Perhaps it should be explained here that in India all sadhus and Saints teach that one should live a life of peace, humility and respect for one’s fellow beings and all other creatures. This prohibits the taking of any life. Ahimsa , the principle of non-violence and non-injury, is the highest precept. If this principle is violated, then shame and remorse are necessary consequences. No argument can be found for a person to defend such actions.

The hunter continued his story.

"I stammered out an answer that the basket contained food for my children, as they needed something to eat.

"With unsparing severity Sri Devpuriji rebuked me: 'And what about these birds and their children that wait for them? Now they will starve to death. Give me the basket'!

"I gave him the basket and as he opened it, all the little birds flew away."

I thanked the former hunter for openly confessing his story and asked what effect this miracle had on him.

"It completely transformed my life," he confided. "I never hunted again."

## [Miraculous Healings](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1515-miraculous-healings)

The details of the following miracle were recounted to me by a man from Kailash who personally witnessed these events [1] .

He began by saying, "Sri Devpuriji had received a wound to the lower part of his right leg. Its condition steadily worsened until finally it began to suppurate. The whole leg was badly inflamed and my father urged Sri Devpuriji to allow a doctor to give treatment.

"Sri Devpuriji however, was unaffected by the state of his leg and only replied, 'If it disturbs you so much I will cut it away'.

"And this he did. Immediately he took hold of his sword, put it to the wound and with one deep cut removed the flesh of his whole calf. Tendons and bone could be seen, but he simply removed his turban, wrapped the wound with the cloth and turning to my father said with a smile, 'Is this better now'?

"My father and I were stunned by what we had just seen. Soon afterward we said our good-byes and left the ashram , still awestruck. The next day we again visited Sri Devpuriji to inquire how he was and he showed us his leg. It was completely healed! Not the slightest sign of any injury or scar could be seen!"

The power of Sri Devpuriji's energy was so great that he was able to cure every ailment. Many who came to him or who silently prayed for help, became well again.

Occasionally he demonstrated these miraculous cures in public and this he did with a young man by the name of Rameshwar Lalji from the village of Vay, near Kailash.

Rameshwar Lalji had long suffered from a chronic disease for which no doctor could bring relief. His own brother, though a doctor, also had no success. Rameshwar Lalji had already suffered for so long that all villagers felt sorry for him and since they had faith and belief in the Divine power of Sri Devpuriji, they called upon him to help the young man.

Sri Devpuriji arrived.

"Give me a paisa ," he said, "and I will eradicate this disease."

The villagers hurried to bring the small coin, which is worth one-hundredth of a rupee . Sri Devpuriji carried the coin to the outskirts of the village where he buried it. Rameshwar Lalji was restored to perfect health that same day. The whole village was filled with the joy of this great blessing, in which they all shared.

In Bari Khatu there lived a Rajput by the name of Ragunath Singhji. He was a courageous man, honourable and fair. In his outstanding honesty he was devoted to Sri Devpuriji, who would often visit his house and light a fire around which all would sit.

The hearth and ashes from the fireplace of a yogi or swami are considered holy, as they contain the blessing and purifying power of the fire. The ash of Sri Devpuriji's hearth in the house of Ragunath Singhji was filled with exceptional healing energy and numerous people recovered from their illnesses when it was given to them as prasad . Even today this place possesses great healing power and is worshipped as a holy shrine by the descendants of Ragunath Singhji.

Sri Mohan Singhji, a relative of the thakur of Bari Khatu, suffered from a serious disease of the liver. In the hope of a cure he sent his good friend Nath Puri to Kailash to invite Sri Devpuriji to his home. Sri Mohan Singhji neglected to tell the messenger of the real reason for his illness, however this did not remain hidden from the Divine sight of Sri Devpuriji. The illness from which the man suffered was caused by many years of excessive drinking and Sri Devpuriji knew that Mohan Singhji had ignored all the advice of his doctors to give up this habit. Thus he gave Nath Puri the following answer to the thakur 's message.

"Soon I will visit Bari Khatu, for near your village is Hari Vasani, where Lord Hari himself has incarnated. Night and day he meditates on me and I have promised to come to him."

With a smile, he added, "I would also visit Mohan Singhji but I am afraid that he will not follow my instructions."

So saying, he handed some holy ashes from his hearth to Nath Puri and sent him back to Khatu. So this messenger was the first to know of the forthcoming meeting between Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji and Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji.

But before I come to tell of this wonderful event I will first mention the outcome of Mohan Singhji's story. Upon receiving the message from the Divine Master, Mohan Singhji recognised the serious admonition and realized that first of all he had to help himself. Mindful of the medical advice given to him, he made the decision to stop drinking. When Sri Devpuriji came to Bari Khatu he also visited Mohan Singhji and saw how he had mended his ways by renouncing alcohol. He thus blessed the relative of the thakur and cured him from his serious illness.



[1] In memory of this incredible event, which left a deep and lifelong impression in the mind of this man, he recently donated a piece of land to Kailash Ashram to build an Ayurvedic hospital. This building was financed by Sadhvi Shanti from Vienna Ashram.

## [The Broken Water Pot](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1513-the-broken-water-pot)



Sri Devpuriji was once walking at the foot of the Khatu Mountains and passed by a quarry where a Muslim man worked. It so happened that one of Sri Devpuriji's dogs knocked over and broke a drinking pot full of water. The Muslim became furious and he berated Sri Devpuriji, who politely apologised.

"Please excuse this mishap, I will bring you another jug full of water."

Due to the general enmity between Hindu and Muslim, the man was not easily pacified. His anger grew until eventually he threatened Sri Devpuriji with police action.

"Well, I would be interested to see what the police will do in such a case," Sri Devpuriji replied, "and so I will voluntarily come with you."

Thus together they went to the police station. On their arrival Sri Devpuriji expressed a need for water, saying that he felt quite thirsty.

Consequently a jug of water was brought and given to him. Sri Devpuriji then proceeded to walk out of the police station and pour the entire contents of the jug into a small hole he had dug in the sand. The police officer and the Muslim watched with increasing curiosity as Sri Devpuriji first washed his face and hands and then called his dogs to come and drink. It was a very hot day and the dogs drank much, but the level of water in the hole remained unchanged.

On seeing this, the police officer reflected on the nature of the desert, which instantly absorbs any amount of water you care to pour on it and respectfully he bowed to the Divine Master.

"O Lord, I thank you for your mercy in granting us the benefit of your presence!"

Ashamed, but profoundly impressed by what he had just witnessed, the Muslim continued to stand there.

Sri Devpuriji said to him, "Go back to your quarry where you will find your jug, undamaged and filled with water."

This Muslim became a disciple of Sri Devpuriji and the event earned the great yogi much reverence and respect throughout the Muslim community and so contributed to a sense of brotherhood between Hindu and Muslim.

## [A Well for the Farmers of Jalunda](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1511-a-well-for-the-farmers-of-jalunda)

Even if Sri Devpuriji no longer taught publicly, it would be wrong to assume that he lived in solitude with no concern for others. Just as the trees, rivers and rain serve all, so too the existence of a Saint benefits the entire world. Indeed, his presence is a blessing to the whole universe. A Saint is the most valuable and noble gift that can be given to humanity. His glory and mercy purify the earth and therefore he is the greatest blessing.

Once a group of villagers from Jalunda came to Sri Devpuriji to ask for his help. For some years there had been a drought and they explained there was no more drinking water. The well of the village provided only salty water, not suitable for drinking. The people and animals were suffering greatly.

Sri Devpuriji promised to help them and immediately set out for Jalunda accompanied by his dogs and snakes. On his arrival at the village, he sat down under a tree and the villagers hurried over to welcome him.

"O Divine Master, please accept our thanks for honouring us with your presence. We will do anything within our power to fulfil your desire."

"I thank you very much," Sri Devpuriji replied, "but I have everything I need. I have not come to make demands upon you, instead I have come to give and to help."

He then indicated to them the place where to dig a well. He also took up a shovel and began to dig, but this the farmers just could not accept.

"Gurudeva, please let us do it! Your mere presence is enough. Our efforts will bear fruit."

Despite these words they secretly doubted they would find water. But, full of determination and good will, they dug into the earth. The whole village community worked together in harmony, like one organism in which the activity of each part is indispensable to the other. This in itself was miraculous and was probably due to the beneficial influence of the Divine Master.

During the next day the villagers struck water. Pure, fresh, sweet water! Their relief and joy were indescribable. They were like fish that, suffering on dry land, finally attain their water element again.

We who live in a dry country are aware of the real value of water. During my visits to Europe, I often would hear people complain when it rained, "How ghastly! What terrible weather!" but I would think of the many people in my homeland who would give everything they possessed for drops of rain.

When the well water began to flow the villagers raised a loud and joyful song of "Sri Devapurisha Mahadeva Ki Jai!" — Victory to the Divine Master Sri Devpuriji!

Since this day the well has always yielded plenty of water for the whole village and this well is shown to all who visit Jalunda. Near the village entrance, a large banyan tree is planted by the well — an ever-green symbol of life in the desert.

## [Trikaldarshi](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/paramyogeshwar-sri-devapuriji/1512-trikaldarshi)

All of life is like an open book to the Divine Master, whose knowledge and experience are unlimited — beyond the dimensions of space and time. But an ordinary person guided by a Guru may also gain the siddhi of trikaldarshitva through intensive meditation and the practice of Yoga. It is by no means easy to achieve and the guidance of a Master is absolutely necessary.

A perfected Master who sees the future also speaks for the future and thus he acts according to its laws. His words and deeds are valid not only for today, but forever.

All else can be wrong and be subject to human relativity. Parents, teachers and scientists can be mistaken, but the words of a Saint are always true. Whoever has achieved Divine Consciousness, where the knower, knowledge and subject of knowledge are one, has access to reality.

Once Sri Devpuriji was taking his morning walk when he met a man from Kailash.

"All the best and blessings for your forthcoming wedding," he greeted. He then gave the date on which this marriage would occur.

The man was bewildered at Sri Devpuriji’s words.

"Sir," he said, "you have confused me with someone else, for I am already married and have children. It is improbable that I will marry again."

However Sri Devpuriji answered, "I know very well that you are married, but your wife will only live three days more and your children will need a mother."

The man was rather perturbed at this news and he returned home unwilling to believe the words of Sri Devpuriji. However, all happened just as Sri Devpuriji had said. After three days his wife became seriously ill with an inflamed bowel and she died within a few hours.

The young widower married a second time on the exact date given by Sri Devpuriji.

The Divine Master always speaks the truth, of this we can be sure. No matter how pleasant, unpleasant or improbable they may seem, his word will always prove to be true.

The thakur [1] of Choti Khatu village had just purchased a camel for the considerable sum of 700 rupees. He was returning to his home when he happened to meet Sri Devpuriji.

"This really is a good camel, but unfortunately you will only get 20 rupees for it."

The thakur was most surprised at this comment.

"Even if I kept the camel for five years I would still receive at least 500 rupees for it!" he shouted excitedly.

"Exactly 20 rupees," was Sri Devpuriji's reply. "You will see."

That same evening the thakur was visited by an acquaintance who was interested in the animal.

"Sir, I would like to buy the camel from you."

"Why not?" the thakur answered. "Today I paid 700 rupees for it and you may take the camel for that same price."

His friend made the following offer: "I am unable to pay the whole amount at once, but if you agree I can give you 20 rupees now and the remainder when I have it."

The thakur agreed, they closed the deal and the man left with the camel.

But as fate would play, the following day the camel suddenly developed a mysterious illness and died. The new owner was desperately afraid of being in such serious debt and went to the thakur to inform him of the terrible news.

"What can I do now? I am unable to repay what I owed, for it was my intention to use the camel to earn money!"

The thakur sighed.

"Don't worry about it, my friend. I was warned by my Guru that I would receive only 20 rupees for the camel and never again will I doubt his words."

On another occasion the same thakur was riding through the desert when he noticed  Sri Devpuriji was standing some 300 metres away. Vigorously he spurred on his horse so as to reach his Master and greet him, but although the animal galloped quickly they didn't come any closer. Mile after mile the thakur rode in vain until finally his horse was completely exhausted. But the distance between him and Sri Devpuriji remained the same.

"Divine Master, ocean of love and kindness," he shouted in desperation. "Please, merciful one, stop your game so that I may greet you!"

Immediately the answer came, "It is improper to ride to a Saint on the back of a horse. Approach respectfully on foot! In a church or mosque, in a temple or ashram , respect is imperative always!"

The thakur realized his mistake and begged forgiveness by bowing to his Master.

Sri Devpuriji explained:

"Give up your ego before the Saint! Only such a pilgrimage will result in blessing. In one moment, the darshan of a Saint can free from ignorance and rebirth that one who approaches with a pure and humble heart. His blessing purifies and washes away the burden of countless sins and karmas from former lives."

The thakur received these words with an open heart and bid goodbye to his Master. After walking some metres away he turned, looked back and saw Sri Devpuriji's body dissolve and disappear into light. Furthermore, later when the thakur returned home he found a letter in which it was clearly indicated that Sri Devpuriji had been in his ashram at Kailash at the time of their meeting in the desert.

Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji had several followers in the village of Sahjoli. One of these was Jaya Ramji, a carpenter by trade and close disciple who had lived with him for some time in the ashram . On paying a visit to Sahjoli, Sri Devpuriji stopped outside Jaya Ramji's house and called out. Jaya Ramji's elder brother Lashi had just retired to his bed and he pretended to be asleep.

"Is your hospitality so poor," Sri Devpuriji called, "that you cannot even rouse yourself to welcome the Saint who has come to visit you? For this lapse in good manners you will spend the next six months in the bed you so obviously enjoy!"

In a short time Lashi Ramji fell ill and really was confined to his bed for six months. This was a harsh but effective lesson.

Sri Devpuriji also gave Jaya Ramji some advice. He recommended that this devotee take his family and leave Sahjoli and move to another village by the name of Bugaradash.

"I see deer grazing here where your house now stands."

As the family could not imagine how and why this should happen they ignored the Saint’s advice. Soon after, they became involved in an altercation with other villagers and found themselves forced to leave their home under unpleasant circumstances. They settled in Bugaradash and there they have lived until this day, in unwavering devotion to Sri Devpuriji. At the place where their house stood in Sahjohli wild animals, including deer, are now thriving.

## [The First Meeting with the Divine Master](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/the-first-meeting/1520-the-first-meeting-with-the-divine-master2)

Soon after Nath Puri left Kailash with his message, Sri Devpuriji made his way to Bari Khatu accompanied by his cows, horse, goats, birds and snakes. His faithful black sheep also followed. On his arrival the villagers gathered in crowds to receive his darshan, for long ago his fame had reached them.

The area surrounding Bari Khatu is quite hilly and the village is located atop one of those hills. However, Sri Devpuriji didn't go directly there, instead he set up camp in a nearby valley.

It was in this valley that the two great souls first came together, where there merged two streams of pure love and light.

On that day Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji had led his cows to graze in this same valley and as he watched them, he suddenly became aware of the presence of Lord Shiva himself standing before him, smiling. With respect and great reverence Mahaprabhuji bowed his head and then with folded hands praised God in this wonderful bhajan .

OM NAMASTE SRI GURUDEVA PURI DAYALAM

Gracious OM in human form, O Devpuriji! Thou manifest the eternal blessing of immortality, Thou lead us from unreality to reality, O Immortal One! Truly Thou art God! Thou art beginning, middle and end, Omniscient and Omnipresent, Unborn and unbound, standing beyond everything, Your Swami Deep worships Thee forever. Sri Devpuriji raised his hands in blessing and spoke to Mahaprabhuji.

"Vishwa Deep, Light of the Universe, myself and yourself are one and the same. Only our bodies differ, but our souls are united. Although the vessels are different, the Light within always remains the same. You personify sat cit ananda — truth, pure consciousness and eternal bliss. As sat sanatan dharma [1] stipulates, we will now commence that holy relationship of Master and disciple."

Then he initiated Mahaprabhuji with a holy mantra . With great reverence, gratitude and joy, Mahaprabhuji accepted the mercy shown by Sri Devpuriji and praised his Divine Guru in the following bhajans .



DHANYA DHANYA HO ES BHAG SIKHANDER

What great Mercy, what fulfilment to have received Thy Blessing, Thou art the highest knowledge, the Master of Thy own Self, Thou dwell in my heart, Thou art Brahman, the Supreme, the Divine Master, In my heart Thou light the Eternal Light, Thou art Krishna, the lover of my soul.

Sri Devpuriji, my Lord and Master, From the depths of my heart Swami Deep celebrates Thy fame.

SADHO BHAI MAHAMANTRAH HAM PAYO

My beloved brothers, I have received the Holy Mantra, Lord Brahma the Creator, Lord Vishnu the Protector And Lord Shiva, the Liberator from every illusion, also had Mantra, As did King Manu, King Raghu, King Dasharatha, Ramchandra, Vishwamitra, the seven Rishis, Guru Goraknath, Nava Nath, Sri Dutta, Maharishi Narada, Sarada, Sheshanag, King Janaka, Muni Ashtavakra, Arjuna and Lord Krishna, Sri Shankaracharya, all Rishis, Munis, Siddhas, Sadhakas And Bhaktas.

Satguru Sri Devpuriji Maharaj has also blessed Swami Deep with a Holy Mantra.

After singing thus the praises of his Divine Guru , Mahaprabhuji requested Sri Devpuriji to bless his parents. So together they left the valley and returned to the village.

Mahaprabhuji's father, Sri Udaipuriji, most respectfully greeted Sri Devpuriji with folded hands.

"Today my life has been fulfilled, for both Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva have appeared before my eyes. Not only our village, but the whole country has been blessed by this visit."

On seeing Sri Devpuriji, Mahaprabhuji's mother, Srimati Chandan Deviji spoke in awe.

"It seems to me that I have seen your holy face before."

"Yes, holy Mother, you remember correctly," Sri Devpuriji replied, "for long ago on Shiva-Ratri I appeared in your meditation and promised I would visit your Divine son. Now I have come."

Srimati Chandan Deviji was fully aware of being blessed by the personal presence of Lord Shiva and she bowed to him with complete devotion. Sri Devpuriji stayed that night in the family house of Mahaprabhuji and on this wonderful evening filled with satsang , no-one ever thought of sleep.



JAYA MATESHWARI JAYA DEVI CHANDAN

Ode to the Divine Mother Hail victory to the Divine Mother, Srimati Chandan Deviji! Vishwa Deep, the Light of the universe, is her son, Glory to Maha Prabhu Deep, glory be his Holy Mother, O Mother! You are the eternal, Divine Mother To whom all Devas pay their respects, Rishis, Munis and Avatars chant your fame, Your mercy liberates from the chains of the world. Bless me, O my Mother!

Your Darshan destroys my worldly bonds, Your Divine son is joy in the world. I, Swami Madhavananda, beg you, Grant your grace upon me and liberate me From all Karmas and sins.

## [The Orange Flag](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/the-first-meeting/1522-the-orange-flag)

After three days, Sri Devpuriji returned.

"Now it is time for you to settle and build an ashram so that all who come to you may experience bliss and achieve spiritual perfection."

Mahaprabhuji respectfully agreed.

"Wherever you direct me I shall live in complete contentment and joy."

Leaving the valley, they walked through the desert region between Hari Vasani and Bari Khatu and came upon a hill which previously had been a cremation ground. People usually avoided this place as they were afraid of ghosts and demons. Sri Devpuriji instructed Mahaprabhuji to allay their fears and by his presence to purify the place forever. On this hill Sri Devpuriji hoisted an orange flag, the sign of an ashram . In praise, Mahaprabhuji sang:



HE NISHAN BHAGVA HINDKA PUJANIK ADI ANADI

Praise to the orange flag, Symbol of Renunciation, Truth and Eternity, Happy are those who stay in its shadow, Those who are ignorant miss this great discovery, My Master, Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji, Revealed this Supreme Knowledge to me! Swami Deep is the messenger of his Satguru.

## [True Devotion](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/the-first-meeting/1521-true-devotion)

The next day, the two Divine souls returned to the valley of their first meeting as Master and disciple and according to tradition, Sri Devpuriji initiated Mahaprabhuji into the holy precepts of yoga.

One day a large crowd had gathered at their camp and Sri Devpuriji instructed Mahaprabhuji to bring prasad for the people. Mahaprabhuji obeyed and as is customary, first offered the prasad with his right hand to Sri Devpuriji. Sri Devpuriji took the prasad but suddenly grasped the hand of his disciple and swiftly inflicted several deep cuts with a knife.

Shocked and frightened, all those present held their breath. But Mahaprabhuji remained quiet and calm and without displaying any emotion or fear, quietly bandaged the wounded hand.

The following day Mahaprabhuji offered prasad with his left hand and to everyone's complete horror Sri Devpuriji again inflicted deep wounds with his knife. Mahaprabhuji remained cheerful and peaceful.

"Deep! By cutting your hands I have endowed them with abundant energy," Sri Devpuriji said, smiling at Mahaprabhuji. "Whoever receives blessing from your hands shall immediately be liberated from fear, need and grief and thus be filled with eternal bliss and peace."

Mahaprabhuji prostrated himself before Sri Devpuriji.

"Holy Master! Whatever comes from you is always a blessing."

On the third day, Sri Devpuriji again demanded prasad and when Mahaprabhuji respectfully offered it, Sri Devpuriji questioned him: "Deep, are you not afraid?"

"No, Holy Master, I know no fear." Mahaprabhuji replied. "Why should I be afraid when you are with me?"

Sri Devpuriji, satisfied with this answer, next asked what was Mahaprabhuji's greatest wish.

"My greatest wish, Holy Master, is Omnipresent Light. Through your grace may all devotees achieve realization of their true Self and always hold you in their consciousness as the everlasting and all-embracing — as sarguna [1] and nirguna [2] .

On hearing this, Sri Devpuriji rose to his feet and pierced Mahaprabhuji's spine with his spear. Much blood was shed, but Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji stood there unmoved, face radiant with his natural gentle smile, his eyes bright.

Sri Devpuriji blessed him.

"You are the Light of the universe. Just as the light of the Sun illuminates the earth, so too does your radiance illumine all of creation. You will light the flame of spiritual realization in those souls fettered to this world by delusion and attachment."

He then removed the spear and placed the ashes from a burnt cloth upon the gaping wound. Immediately the bleeding stopped and the wound closed.

After this day, Sri Devpuriji left the valley for the solitary peace of the mountains and Mahaprabhuji remained behind to meditate on the immeasurable blessings he had received and waited for his Master's return. His wounds caused him no pain and healed rapidly however the scars remained for the remainder of his life. A visible sign for all the faithful of what he willingly and readily accepted in complete trust and perfect devotion, from God Himself.



[1] sarguna = God with form, i.e., the personal aspect of God

[2] nirguna = God without form, i.e., the all-pervasive aspect of God

## [Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram](https://www.lilaamrit.org/incarnation/the-first-meeting/1523-sri-deva-dungary-sannyas-ashram)

As soon as the place of Mahaprabhuji's future residence was decided, Sri Devpuriji re­turned to Kailash and Maha­prabhuji began building the new ashram . The people of the area had known Mahaprabhuji since childhood and they worshipped him. Overjoyed that they were going to live near him, they enthusiastically helped erect a single-storied ashram on the hilltop. Mahaprabhuji named it "Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram."

Today it is hard to believe that once this place was thought to be haunted by evil spirits, for now only a holy peace can be felt. That this peace still pervades the area is due to Mahaprabhuji's long life and presence there. Each and every stone and grain of sand is saturated with the blessing and Divine energy of his radiance.

The ashram is situated in a beautiful, natural setting. Modern technology has yet to invade and spoil the peaceful serenity and beauty of the desert. Hardly a house can be seen from the ashram . Almost invisible paths wind through the sparse countryside from the village, which is two kilometres away. At a distance of three kilometres there stretches a range of hills. The centre of the range, having been exposed to the vagaries of harsh weather, is precipitous and rocky, yet its peaks are flat and sandy. One large, rocky opening appears through the hill like a gigantic door and this rocky gate is the entrance to the village of Bari Khatu. Apart from these hills, only the quiet of the desert surrounds the ashram . To stand there and behold this im­pressive view in the warm sun with a gentle breeze blowing on one’s skin, brings an indescribable feeling. Nothing can be heard except the occasional and distinctive cry of peacocks. If Mahaprabhuji is the Ocean of Mercy, then the ashram of Khatu must be the ark upon which it floats.

The Western equivalent of an ashram is a monastery. The head of the ashram is a swami and often several other monks, holy men or women live there.

The " a " of the word ashram means "welcome" and the " shram " means "to do something." An ashram is that place where all are welcome to come and do something for the benefit of their body, mind and soul.

The swami , Self-realized one, or Master who lives there, is visited by disciples, spiritual seekers, wandering sadhus and others. The duration of their stay is not fixed and the duties, studies and special training practised there are completely in the hands of the swami .

In Mahaprabhuji's ashram everyone was welcome regard­less of status, caste, nationality, religion or gender. It could not be any other way, for we are all children of the One God.

Each evening a satsang was held. Such gatherings gave immense, blissful relief to the soul. Enveloped in silence, beneath the blanket of the night sky adorned with sparkling stars, people from all around camped in the warm sand.

A small fire was kept burning and before it sat Mahaprabhuji, chanting his Divine bhajans in a melodious voice. He accompanied himself on the tanpura , always composing new and wonderful songs. Rarely did he sing the same bhajan twice. Poems and melodies were spontaneously created. What a truly heavenly talent!

After singing bhajans Mahaprabhuji would explain them in a way that was easy for all to understand the essence and meaning of his Divine compositions. His songs reveal the spiritual message about the true science of yoga. They are hymns to God and to Mahaprabhuji’s Divine Master, Sri Devpuriji.

During satsang, the disciples always sat at a distance of three or four metres from Mahaprabhuji. This was because his spiritual radiance was so strong, that anyone who tried to get nearer was dazed by his brilliant vibration. It was almost impossible to look directly into his eyes, as it was just like looking into the sun.

Mahaprabhuji was aware of everything about the people who came to him. Their thoughts, feelings, emotions and most secret wishes — all were revealed to him. But of course those who met him had to decide for themselves who Mahaprabhuji really was and blessed were those who recognised him as an incarnation of God, the Divine One who knows the hearts of all people.

## [Meeting with Mahatma Gandhi](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1551-meeting-with-mahatma-gandhi)

At that time in India the political situation was quite unstable. Mahatma Gandhi and his helpers did what they could for the independence of the country. However, the British tried to suppress all efforts for freedom and kept the Indian people down by force and inflicted severe punishment. The Indians were afraid of the British rulers, who had a great army equipped with modern weapons, while they were armed only with their courage and bravery. Many of them believed that to rebel against the powerful British Empire would be futile. Mahaprabhuji encouraged them to strive for freedom through patience and perseverance and not with force.

Mahaprabhuji foretold that an end would soon come to British rule and due to his inspiration, hundreds of Indians regained courage through belief in his protection.

Once when Mahaprabhuji and some disciples were in Mount Abu they decided to go to Sabarmati, the ashram of Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi came to the door of the ashram to welcome Mahaprabhuji and indeed it was a great moment when these two outstanding personalities met.

Mahatma Gandhi requested Mahaprabhuji sing one of his bhajans .

"Master, please grant us the opportunity to hear your famous songs, which we are told deeply move the hearts of all and fill them with Divine Light. Your existence in this world truly leads everyone to the path of liberation!"

"And it is your existence which serves to liberate the Indian people," Mahaprabhuji said in reply. "No-one can stop you in this. Your service to India will make history and the story of your life will always be an inspiration to others."

Mahaprabhuji then sang a bhajan and finally spoke to those present.

"My dear people! India is the country of ahimsa [1] , none will ever suffer due to us. The Vedas expound ahimsa as the highest principle in human dharma . Do not give up this principle! Truth cannot be destroyed or changed, it is pure. Truth will always reign victorious [2] . Live simply with an honest heart and high thoughts. Honour your trade and respect the traditions. Mahatma Gandhi is a brilliant example for you in this!

"In a former life he was King Ajayapal, who himself tended the goats of the kingdom and he reigned successfully with wisdom and simplicity. Not only did the people worship him, but the animals as well. During his rule the mighty demon Ravana ruled in Sri Lanka and he demanded tributes from all Indian kings. But even the mighty Ravana was afraid of King Ajayapal.

"One day Ravana said to his queen, Mandodari: 'Today I shall put the powers of Ajayapal to a test'. The queen at that moment was feeding her doves and on a sudden impulse she spoke to them, 'Doves! If you are loyal to King Ajayapal, don't eat these grains'. The doves hid their heads under their wings and kept away from the feed.

"However, one dove didn't hear the queen's words and ate the grain. Immediately it died. The queen turned to Ravana and said, 'This is an ill omen. You now know the might of King Ajayapal'.

"But Ravana didn't care for such signs and instead sent his emissaries to the king demanding tribute. On reaching the court, the emissaries learned that the king was away tending the goats, so they waited for him to return. In the evening, the king heard of the arrival of the emissaries and put on his best robes and welcomed the visitors in the throne room of his palace. The emissaries delivered the message from Ravana.

"King Ajayapal then ordered the emissaries to go into the courtyard and make a drawing in the sand of Ravana's palace. When they had finished, King Ajayapal took a stick and smudged a part of the drawing. He then turned to the visitors with a smile and said, 'Return to Ravana's palace and if you find levelled to the ground this part of the royal walls that I have here erased with my stick, then tell your king that I would well advise him to demand no tribute ever more'!

"He continued, 'In just this way I could destroy all Sri Lanka without stepping out of my palace. Now go to your king and report this to him'.

"The emissaries returned to Ravana and found exactly that part of the palace which King Ajayapal had smudged in the sand indeed had fallen to the ground. This incident so thoroughly frightened Ravana that never again did he quarrel with King Ajayapal.

"Mahatma Gandhi is the reincarnation of this great king. In this life also he carries the shepherd's crook in his hand. Wherever he goes, people are subject to his crook. The power of his devotion to India will ensure victory over the British."

The listeners were deeply moved by Gurudeva's words, for they knew that he always spoke the truth. After this meaningful meeting with Gandhi, Mahaprabhuji returned to Mount Abu.

On the day of Gurupurnima, thousands of devotees came to Mahaprabhuji's satsang .

"Lord, you promised us swarajaya — self-determination," one of them said. "Please tell us how long India will remain free and how things will be for our country in the future. When will a new satya yuga begin, when Saints and wise men will again rule over the land? And when will you, God's incarnation, return to build the kingdom of sat sanatan dharma ?"

"These questions touch the core of the universe, so listen well," Mahaprabhuji answered with a smile.

"The independence of India will last for a very long time and thereafter many forms of government will follow. Finally, at the beginning of satya yuga , the age of truth, the great rishis and wise men will incarnate from the highest level and build the kingdom of wisdom on earth."

In a bhajan , Mahaprabhuji continued:



HO RAJ MAHARISHAYA KO HO VELA RE

May it be soon that wise men rule the states! The Mahatma has appeared to extinguish the castes, He will clean India's system, Difference in race and status will be abolished, Now the era of arrogance ends.

Satguru Sri Devpuriji proclaimed this truth And Swami Deep is his ambassador, Under the gracious protection of the Guru He realizes the unfathomable Lila, the Divine Play.

After this bhajan , Mahaprabhuji prophesied that at the end of the rule of Saints, he himself would again incarnate on earth, in conformity with the words of The Bhagavad Gita that says: God always comes to earth to re-establish the empire of Truth, when true faith is in danger.

"When I descend to earth from the Divine level of satya loka , satya yuga will again blossom with me. I will build the kingdom of true dharma , without battle or war and people will follow me in love. The whole cosmos is in Me — I am the Universe."



[1] ahimsa = non-violence. Not to harm or kill is the highest principle of human life.

[2] "Truth will always reign victorious" — SATYA MEVA JAYATE — is the motto of the Indian union.

## [Books in the Sacred Fire](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1544-books-in-the-sacred-fire)

Once when Sri Devpuriji was staying near Khatu, Thakur Ishvar Singhji of Choti Khatu came to visit and invited Sri Devpuriji to his palace. He accepted the invitation.

"Expect me tomorrow morning at ten o'clock."

The thakur returned to his palace to make preparations for Gurudeva's arrival. At exactly ten o'clock the next morning, Sri Devpuriji appeared and the family of the thakur received him with full honours. Thakur Ishvar Singhji showed Sri Devpuriji his house and took him to the library, which contained many books. After looking at them, Sri Devpuriji ordered all to be carried to the courtyard and placed in a pile. Next he demanded a can of petrol, which he poured over the books and then set alight. Sitting before the fire, he meditated just as if he were before his own sacred fireplace.

The thakur watched this with mixed feelings. On the one hand he grieved for the loss of his most treasured books but on the other hand he dared not oppose the will of his Gurudeva.

When finally the fire had subsided, Sri Devpuriji turned with a smile to the thakur .

"Most of your books were useless, therefore I made a selection of only those that were truly precious. Look here! Five books have been spared by the fire. These are those holy texts which will bring benefit and blessing to you and the whole world."

Astonished, Thakur Ishvar Singhji and his family acknowledged this miracle that Sri Devpuriji had performed. Until the end of his life, the thakur read no books other than those five holy texts which had been saved from the fire.

## [Sight for the Blind](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1537-sight-for-the-blind)

About two kilometres from Khatu Ashram, is the village of Kachras where there lived a blind man called Rama. Daily he visited the ashram to bring wood and cowpats for the fire.

One day Mahaprabhuji asked him the reason for his faithful and regular visits.

"O Lord, just to see you," Rama replied.

"But you are blind Rama," said Mahaprabhuji. "How can you see me?"

With folded hands Rama answered, "Gracious one! I am sure that one day you will grant me sight and then I will be able to behold your physical form just as I now share in your Divine sight with my inner eye."

The carpenter Jaya Ramji was sitting beside Mahaprabhuji and Mahaprabhuji instructed him to bring a ch a pati [1] . Gurudeva then broke the bread in half and gave one piece to Jaya Ramji.

"Give this to Rama," he said.

As Rama ate the chapati , light poured into his eyes and he could see!

How can I describe his utter joy and immense gratitude? Indeed, the whole village was amazed and they understood that this miracle was a great blessing them all. And so it was proven that whatever is longed for with a pure heart will soon come to be, by the blessing of Gurudeva. Nothing is beyond the power of that One Omnipotent, who is manifest in Gurudeva and who works through him. This is the nature of a true Master. He never takes, his life is devoted only to giving.

## [The Banyan Leaf and The Match](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1542-the-banyan-leaf-and-the-match)

One day while on a walk in the desert, Mahaprabhuji picked a leaf from a banyan tree and brought it back to the ashram . He dug a shallow hole in the sand of the courtyard and placed the leaf there. Miraculously the leaf remained fresh and green and showed no sign of wilting.

Mahaprabhuji explained: "This leaf belongs to Lord Rama. Whosoever wishes to meet Rama may come here and look at it."

Most of the disciples were unable to understand what Mahaprabhuji meant by this and although he called on them again and again to look at the leaf and to think about what he had said, the hidden meaning became clear only to a few.

The leaf represented two things. First, that all laws of nature originate in God, the Omnipotent, who has control over them. Saints like Mahaprabhuji who are manifestations of God the Omnipotent, also have command over these laws of nature. Therefore the leaf remained fresh and green and did not blow away in the breeze. Second, that one who worships Lord Rama and whose thoughts are directed to Him, will be granted the Divine unity of health and spiritual purity - to this person, vitality and freshness are given like the ever-green leaf.

At other times Mahaprabhuji would light a match while a strong wind blew, but the flame would steadily keep burning. This was a symbol that those who take refuge in Gurudeva will certainly be sheltered through all of life’s storms.

## [The Reproach of Sri Devpuriji](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1543-the-reproach-of-sri-devpuriji)

Once numerous devotees had gathered for satsang and their songs and prayers resounded far and wide. Suddenly a horse appeared and approached the ashram at full gallop but no rider could be seen on its back. Only the glint of a shining sword flashed in the sun. The disciples wondered at this, when Mahaprabhuji explained.

"This is a sign that my Guru , Sri Devpuriji, is coming. Move out of the way quickly!"

At that same moment Yogiraj Sri Devpuriji entered the ashram and in an enraged voice cried, "Deep! What is all this maya you create here with leaf and match stick. I have come to remove it."

So saying, he took the leaf that lay in the sand. He then ordered the disciples to pile up all musical instruments, books, blankets and household goods of the ashram . These he set on fire.

Surprised and afraid, the disciples hid themselves from Sri Devpuriji. Only Mahaprabhuji remained relaxed and calm. After some time Sri Nathulal Meghwal a close disciple, dared to come out and spoke respectfully to Sri Devpuriji.

"Mahadeva, why do you destroy our instruments, on which we play to honour Thy name? How shall we celebrate satsang now?"

Without anger and with great compassion and mercy, Sri Devpuriji replied, "I did not destroy these instruments but sent them to deva loka [1] to Lord Indra and his celestial companions. They also praise Sri Vishwa Deep, the Light of the Universe. Don't worry, you will get everything back and much, much more."

Sri Devpuriji then asked for the ashram cash box and took out all the silver coins and began to hammer them, splitting each one into four pieces. These he then scattered around the ashram .

"I am sowing the coins here for the devotees of Sri Deep Mahaprabhuji so that none among the true devotees shall ever remain poor."

Eventually Sri Devpuriji sat down and Mahaprabhuji prostrated himself respectfully before him. With folded hands he recited the following prayer:



AB TUM DAYA KARO GURUDEVA JI

Have mercy on us, Gurudeva, The dweller of Kailash, We are your devotees, we seek refuge at your feet, Through you we cross the ocean of the world, You are indescribable, unborn and perfect, Remove all doubts and Karmas from us, You lead your devotees to the path of Truth.

Shiva –Yogi, great Lord! Infinite and unfathomable is your Divine play, Your Lila radiates the whole universe, You are the creator of everything, Without cause, boundless, without attachment Your being originates from you, yourself.

Just as the stars are mirrored in the water So you sparkle in every heart, You are the Supreme Being, kind and generous, Lord, protect us forever!

You are the Preserver of the Cosmos, Your wisdom and mercy are infinite, Words are unable to describe you, You have equal love for all creatures.

Sometimes you withdraw yourself in silence, Meeting with you means the path to Moksha, You are completely free, without attachment, You are the essence of purity — like Sattva Guna, You liberate us from ego and vanity.

I met Sri Devpuriji, my Satguru, He taught me the sound of So Ham, Your devotee Swami Deep Hari praises your fame, You unite Turiya [2] in us!

OM  NITYA  SUDHAM  NIRABHASHAM  NIRAKAR   NIRANJANAM (from the Guru Gita)

I bow at the feet of my Satguru, He is OM, Eternal, unblemished, Perfect, unchangeable Reality, Perpetual Bliss, he is Brahman.

He pervades the whole Cosmos, animate and inanimate Creation Before him who is pure Consciousness, beyond space and time, Beyond birth and death, beyond all duality, Before you, Gurudeva, I bow.

Before him who through his grace Liberates devotees from the burden of the world, O Gurudeva, before him — Sat Chit Ananda [3] — I bow.

After offering this prayer, Mahaprabhuji once again bowed to Sri Devpuriji.

"O Vishwa Deep!" Sri Devpuriji replied, "In their ignorance, the people are incapable of understanding the secrets of my Divine play."

"Lord Shiva himself, you are," Mahaprabhuji answered. "No holy scripture, no Veda or text could ever describe your greatness. You can only be described as ' neti neti ' [4] , for without your grace no-one can recognise you. A poet once said, 'Never fear the anger of a Saint for it is like the cloud which brings life-giving rain'. Your anger is like fire but it only serves to destroy all the evil in man."

Sri Devpuriji mounted his horse and left the ashram and slowly the perplexed disciples gathered in a group view at the charred remains of what Sri Devpuriji had burnt. They wondered how they would continue ashram life without the tools required for everyday use, especially since now there were no funds to procure more.

Sensing their despair, Mahaprabhuji reassured them, "Don't worry. Within a short time we will get everything back."

Suddenly they heard the noise of an engine. A truck came and stopped in front of the ashram . It was loaded with household goods. The driver reverently bowed to Mahaprabhuji and asked that he accept the goods as donation. The disciples were amazed, nobody knew the man nor from where he had come. Joyfully they unloaded the truck and brought everything to Mahaprabhuji while praising the name of Gurudeva!



This story retold by his H.H. Swamiji in Satsang at Dungog Ashram, Australia January 2010







[1] deva loka = kingdom of the gods

[2] turiya = "above the Trinity", it is that highest state of consciousness where there is the unification of knowledge, knower and the subject of knowledge. It is also the seeing of the three chronological dimensions: past, present and future.

[3] sat = truth, chitta = consciousness, ananda = bliss

[4] neti neti = literally "not this, not that", that is, God is not this and not that. The nature of God is beyond definable terms, therefore the only possible description of God is the exclusion of the non-applicable. The power of the intellect is limited in its perception, for the limited is unable to grasp That which is unlimited. The changeable is unable to grasp That which is unchangeable.

## [Panch Dhuni - The Five Fires](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1546-panch-dhuni-the-five-fires)

It is the custom among a certain group of yogis , adherents of ascetic ideals, to meditate in the midst of a circle of five great fires and this they do in a country where the temperature often reaches 50 degrees celsius! These yogis consider this tapasya a great achievement.

The leader of one such group was Sri Jankidasji, an arrogant man who was obsessed with the idea that asceticism and harshness on oneself was the best and only true path to God. He once visited Mahaprabhuji with his followers, intending to persuade Mahaprabhuji to follow his way.

"Look at us! We are true ascetics who have renounced the world," he spoke impertinently to Mahaprabhuji. "In the middle of panch dhuni [1] we subject our bodies to difficult practices of penance. You had best follow us and practise this tapasya instead of giving useless speeches to your disciples!"

Mahaprabhuji just smiled at the opinion of these misdirected sadhus and sang to them the following bhajan :



KYA TUM DHUNI SILGAVE

O, you Yogis, For what do you build fireplaces in the mountains and jungle? My fire burns without wood, its smoke is invisible, In its centre flows the Ganges and Yogis bathe in it, The all-pervasive sound of their song is filled with celestial harmony, If you search for these Yogis you will not find them But they are very near, They dwell in every heart, even though they are far away, Indescribable, pure, immortal, Liberated from the cycle of rebirth, Exceeding the six Chakras, they remain in Siddhasan [2] , Mahaprabhuji says, only a few find this fire.



The sadhus listened attentively and then asked Maha­prabhuji to explain the meaning of the bhajan .

"The fire of which I sang is the Eternal Light of life which has its home in every heart. It needs no wood or any other fuel. The flowing of the Ganges refers to the nadis [3] which, when brought to life through the practice of yoga, leads one's consciousness to the state of medi­tation. The flowing of the Ganges also symbolises the river of love.

"The Divine Self, experienced in meditation, is eternal and infinite. Although it is always present in you, it seems far away and difficult to reach. Only by the sacrifice of your ego can it be found. Purifying yourself through meditation, you will obtain liberation from birth and death. This happens if you can give life to those latent powers within the chakras !"

The arrogance of the sadhus was swept away and with great attention they listened as Mahaprabhuji continued.

"Yogis! Where the spirit is constantly merged with the Supreme, there is fire, there is meditation [4] . Those who warm themselves at this fire burn all their karmas . A fire of burning wood can only drive away the sensation of cold, but the spiritual fire of meditation removes the frost of ignorance from the soul."

"Merciful Master," the sadhus respectfully requested, "please tell us where we can find this fire."

So Mahaprabhuji taught them to bring life to the inner, spiritual fire.

"To find this fire, close the ten doors [5] and direct your gaze toward your inner Self. In So Ham [6] , prana and apana [7] are united and the inner space is opened. So you enter into samadhi [8] . Here is the fire. In this state the soul is happy, like the child who meets its mother after a long separation. The Self is soaked with Divine Consciousness. When prana and apana unite in the manipur chakra [9] the power of kundalini [10] is awakened. In agya chakra [11] there appears a silvery light shining like the full moon. The 'thousand petalled lotus', the seat of the true Self, opens in all its radiant splendour. Who comes there to turiya is Omniscient, past, present and future are revealed. Purusha is experienced, the true Self, the highest consciousness. This is granted through the blessing of the Master, who leads the aspirant to this insight and to perfection."

The sadhus were deeply moved.

"Holy Master, through meeting you we have received the key to the meaning of life. For the sake of this knowledge, which has now been granted to us from your lips, we became sadhus . However, until today this knowledge was kept from us. No-one had revealed to us the inner fire and therefore in our ignorance we strove to discover it externally."

Full of gratitude, the sadhus left the ashram having received the greatest gift — that of true insight which leads to enlightenment.



[1] panch = five, dhuni = fireplace

[2] siddhasan literally means "perfect seat", it is the classical posture for meditation.

[3] nadis are the pathways of energy that flow throughout the body. The three major nadis are ida , the moon system, pingala , the sun system and sushumna , the centre channel. The corresponding physiological functions are respectively, the sympathetic, parasympathetic and central nervous systems.

[4] The Sanskrit words for fireplace ( dhuni ) and meditation ( dhyana ) are linguistically closely related, hence the concepts are also closely related.

[5] The ten doors of the body are the eyes, nose, ears, mouth, the urinary and excretory systems, as well as the sahasrar chakra situated at the top of the head.

[6] So Ham = "I am That", i.e., "I am the Divine Self"

[7] prana = rising energy, also inhalation, apana = descending energy, also exhalation

[8] samadhi = state of highest consciousness, where knowledge, knower and the subject of knowledge become one

[9] manipur chakra = third chakra at the navel centre, the "navel lotus"

[10] kundalini = latent power or energy dormant at the base of the spine

[11] agya chakra = sixth chakra , located in the forehead between the eyebrows

## [Lila - the Divine Play](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1548-lila-the-divine-play)

Once a group of actors came to Mahaprabhuji from Vrindavan, the birthplace of Lord Krishna, to perform a play. When they appeared before him he declined their offer.

" Yogis and swamis do not need this kind of theatre, for in meditation their concentration is always on the Divine Play."

To make clear what he meant, Mahaprabhuji sang a bhajan for them which contains the essence of yoga.



GAGANA MANDAL ME RASA RACHAYA

Enter your inner space for the play there, Concentrate your consciousness on your lover, on God.

The petals of the lotus are opened and in full bloom, In it is the Divine Play.

Here is the sound of the white bee, Here the dance of the black swan takes place, Where water is thirsty and air desires to sit down by fire, Where the fire is cool and water burns.

Only a few Realized ones know this play, Pure consciousness, innocent like the child, provides the spark, The Yogi kindles the fire but the fire makes the Yogi, There, where stone is salty and salt has no flavour.

The ruler of this play is Shiva's Divine Consciousness, Who meditates on him can see this Divine Play And reach the inaccessible, which is beyond all knowledge.

Liberation hangs by a single thread, Sri Alakh Puriji gave the key And Paramyogeshwar, Sri Devpuriji, my Divine Master Holds it in his hands.

Mahaprabhuji continued:

ULTINAL LAGHI TRIVENI

The three rising streams are united in Triveni [1] full of nectar, The Yogis who unite with God enjoy it. One blossom opens downward, then all blossoms above awaken [2] , If the blossoms unite with each other you will see the Formless. Between the blossoms, flows the play of your destiny, There flickers the flame of your life, Beyond this flame you discover the eternal shrine of Divine Light, Your Self is united with it. This is the Divine Play, only a few succeed to share in it, Swami Deep saw it and Realized, the world is only a shadow.



I am happy to tell you the result of this meeting was that those actors, who had until then made a living by playing the role of Divine personalities, began to meditate to seek the Divine Play within.





[1] triveni = "three banks", it is the three nadis of ida , pingala and sushumna that unite in triveni . The nectar is the flow of prana , which is the result of the merging of these streams.

[2] blossom here means "lotus" or chakra . The bloom which opens downward symbolises the muladhar chakra . If this energy rises and unites with the other chakras , then the arousal of the kundalini occurs, which leads one's consciousness to samadhi .

## [Victory Over False Pride](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1550-victory-over-false-pride)

Ego! How this small yet powerful part of man can be completely blind! It is like a destructive drug, for whoever falls victim to ego loses everything. It is like a wild animal that destroys everything in its path without consideration. Destruction of others and of one’s self, is the result of an uncontrolled ego.

Nourishment for the powerful ego is found in the intellect. Intellect is both wonderful and dangerous. Trained, developed and properly used, the intellect is one of the highest faculties. However if used improperly, the intellect only gathers impressions and passes judgement. Nothing is integrated, nothing is experienced and Reality is disregarded. The intellect then believes itself to be Omniscient and Master of the world.

There is a wise Indian saying. There are eight manifestations of mental alcohol which blind the intellect: pride of race, of youth, of beauty, of physical strength, of family, of position, of money and of knowledge. Vanity blinds like the strutting arrogance of a drunkard who considers himself superhuman. In reality he has lost control. Many people suffer from the illness of pride, which brings symptoms of jealousy, being argumentative, hate and distrust.

It’s not difficult to carry a full water pot on the top of your head, as they do in India, but you will not get far before a half-filled one sloshes and spills. In the same way, the mind is always subject to disturbance as long as knowledge is imperfect and incomplete.

This is how it was with one group of men who had retired from their profession. Formerly railway officials, professors, military men and Sanskrit scholars, each of them possessed a certain amount of knowledge and skill,  but were terribly conceited about them. Having nothing to do, they passed their time travelling around, humiliating people by challenging debates. They especially liked to embarrass other learned men or swamis with their practiced questioning.

One day, this group came to Mahaprabhuji's ashram as he was holding satsang .

"We have heard you are a great scholar and we have come to be convinced it is so," one of them provocatively asked. "Tell us what you know!"

Mahaprabhuji had no chance to reply before another interrupted, who had some poetic ability.

"Recite one of your poems, we want to assess your skill!"

Remaining peaceful, Mahaprabhuji welcomed the men with a loving heart, just as he welcomed all visitors and graciously invited them to sit down. He looked at them and as nothing was hidden from him, he knew their thoughts and characteristics. In a bhajan he began to reveal their negative attributes, so as to instruct them in better behaviour.

Dear readers, it is difficult to translate Mahaprabhuji's beautiful poetry into English, as it has quite a different feeling in Hindi. Therefore I can only attempt to convey the general essence of that bhajan here.



KAHA VED PATHI TRIPATHI KAHAVE

Those who study and call themselves scholars, Those who consider themselves poets, Those who dress themselves like holy men, Those who prize external cleanliness, What do they gain if they have not studied the Supreme Or purified their mind? If they have not realized God, What’s the use of poetry or a splendid gown? Those who study law yet still don't know the law of God, Those who think only of their body Which will one day be ash spread by the wind, What can they gain from this? Only God can stop the fallacy of such thoughts, Without Him, all is just pretence.



In further verses the bhajan refers to the true aim of life: to behave well and not only to ‘appear’ well.

Suddenly it seemed to these retired men, that they had accomplished absolutely nothing in their entire lives. They were seized with sorrow as they realized that they were growing old and might not have much time to make amends.

"O Master," they cried, "is it really too late for us? We surrender ourselves to you and humbly beg your guidance and protection. Gracious Lord, can you forgive us?"

Mahaprabhuji's heart is full of love for all creatures and there was no question of anger or annoyance within him. He denied no one, forgave all and corrected and removed the negative qualities of those who put their trust in him. Lovingly he looked at them and sang again:



SANTO SE KOI SIROMANI MANUSYA

The Saint is the crown of humanity! The Gita, Ramayana, Bible and Koran all praise the glory of Saints, Their words shower all mankind in Blessing. The Saint selflessly gives, he gives everything to everyone, He lives not for himself, he lives only for others, As a messenger of God, he comes in love and compassion To purify the world of sins! God's mercy we experience through the blessing of the Saint, The Saint is unsurpassed In love, devotion, humility, kindness and mercy.



When Mahaprabhuji had finished the bhajan , he said, "With the blessing of a Saint it is possible to realize everything, but don't be deceived, dear brothers! As you well know, the ego surrounds itself with the appearance of wisdom and many call themselves holy or pretend to be wise. Go where your thirst will be quenched. If your heart is really seeking then you will find your Master. My dears, your prayers for forgiveness are heard, it is never too late to do good, every second is valuable."

The men begged Gurudeva, "Lord, please initiate us and take us as your disciples."

"I will give you a mantra which you shall practise every day," Mahaprabhuji answered. "From now on learn to be as kind and humble to all as much you were unkind before. Never forget there is something you can learn from everyone and only God the Almighty is perfect."

Grateful for his words, they left Mahaprabhuji and praised him with all their hearts. For these men the following words from The Ramayana proved true: "Only by God's mercy is it possible to meet a realized Master."

## [The Destiny of a Pea](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1541-the-destiny-of-a-pea)

In Nagpur there lived a grain dealer. One day while eating roasted chickpeas, he threw a handful into his mouth and one lodged in his nose. No matter how he tried, he was unable to get it out. Due to the intense pain, he consulted a physician who said that only surgery could help, but since the merchant was afraid of hospitals he didn't want to know anything about it.

By a lucky coincidence, he met a disciple of Mahaprabhuji who advised him to seek the help of Gurudeva.

"He can certainly help you, as he removes all evils whether great or small." Instantly the merchant drove in his carriage to Khatu.

When Mahaprabhuji saw him, he softly chided, "People consult a Saint only when they are really badly off!"

Before the grain dealer could explain his problem, Mahaprabhuji directly gave him the following instructions: "Return to Nagpur. As soon as you see a white hen belonging to a Christian, your pain will come to an end."

Mahaprabhuji then told the merchant the address of the Christian. Totally confused, the trader hurried back to Nagpur. Without difficulty he found the house of the Christian and saw in the yard, a white hen scratching about. At the sight of her the merchant sneezed powerfully. As a result, the chickpea flew out of his nose and landed directly in front of the little white hen. Instantly she pecked it up!

The grain dealer dashed back into his carriage and once more drove to Khatu to thank his benefactor.

Mahaprabhuji explained with a smile.

"Each grain has its fate as to whom it shall serve as nourishment. The pea in your nose was destined for that little white hen and not for you. God's ways are often strange. Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto truth and remember God."

## [Mahaprabhuji's Father Leaves the World](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1545-mahaprabhujis-father-leaves-the-world)

To the surprise of his disciples, Mahaprabhuji unexpectedly left the ashram one day and proceeded to his home village of Hari Vasani. When asked the reason for his sudden departure, Mahaprabhuji said his father would soon farewell this world and so wanted to pay his last respects.

When Mahaprabhuji greeted his father, Sri Udaipuriji's face shone with joy.

"Welcome to you, Infinite Light," he said. "Happy and blessed I am that you have come to be with me in my final hours. Now that I have been permitted to see your face once again, I can peacefully depart this world. My last request to you is that you care for your younger brothers and sister. I now leave this world which has been only a short stage on the journey of my soul."

Mahaprabhuji affectionately answered, "Don't worry about your relatives, God takes responsibility for all who are devoted to him. I will always lovingly watch over them. Find your peace in the bliss of the Eternal Brahman. Nothing belongs to you. Follow this truth and think of God."

"Vishwa Deep, Supreme, your Divine presence fills me with inexpressible bliss," his father replied.

Thereupon Sri Udaipuriji chanted OM, OM, OM and with his last breath looked into the face of his Divine son and saw the form of God, with whom his soul was now united.

Mahaprabhuji made all the necessary preparations for the burial of his father, who was interred according to tradition in a small temple, called samadhi . Several thousand people attended the ceremony and after the funeral proceedings Mahaprabhuji spoke to his mother.

"Blessed Mother, it is God's will that I cannot be nearer to you, but you need not worry at all because my spirit and my protection is always with you."

She smiled and answered, "Wherever you are it is an immense blessing for the land and the people. Through you they will be liberated. Your presence brings peace and good fortune for everyone. My only request is that you please try to be with me in the hour of my departure."

"Divine Mother, even from a distance of a thousand kilometres I will be by your side," Mahaprabhuji said, with his hands folded over his heart. "I promise to be with you when the time comes for you to leave this world."

Then with great reverence, he bade farewell to all and left Hari Vasani to visit the famous places of pilgrimage in India before returning to Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram.

## [The Gift of Life](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1538-the-gift-of-life)

The village of Pirojpura is about three kilometres from Khatu and a great misfortune had befallen one farmer, Amra Ram. Each of his children died just a few months after birth and now his fourth child, a boy of two months, suddenly fell ill and passed away. In utter grief and despair the parents wept at their loss and for their cruel fate. Then suddenly the mother received the Divine inspiration to take her child to Mahaprabhuji.

"He will certainly help me," she thought, "as I have heard of his numerous miracles. Surely he will take pity on me and grant life back to my son."

Carefully she laid the baby in a basket, covered it with a cloth and carried it to the ashram where Mahaprabhuji was sitting in discussion with some disciples. She placed the basket at his feet.

"O Lord, no-one goes from your door empty-handed," she ex­claimed in desperation. "Please also take pity on me, a poor wretched woman!"

Mahaprabhuji directed a disciple to look at what was inside the basket and he reported that a dead child was within. Mahaprabhuji then spoke to the mother.

"Why do you bring him to me? Everyone enters this life due to their karma and leaves again according to karmic law."

But how was this poor, pitiable farmer's wife able to understand this? All she knew was that she had lost one child after another.

Still confident that Mahaprabhuji would help her, she repeated several times, "Lord, you have helped so many, why not me also? Please grant me your blessing."

To add weight to her plea she said, "Lord, my family has been close to Yours for so many years, surely you could be especially gracious to us."

Mahaprabhuji smiled and turned to his disciples.

"She doesn't know that for one who has renounced the world all men and women are the same. He sees the whole world as his family. But her ignorance is born of innocence and she has spoken the truth with great longing. Therefore her wish should be fulfilled."

And with this he lifted the child into his arms.

"Open your eyes little one and tell me why you have caused so much trouble here in my ashram. Continue to live with your family, but in your mind remain forever with me."

The power of Gurudeva's words is like that of the rising sun bringing life to all of nature every day. The baby boy opened his eyes and looked up at Mahaprabhuji. The mother and all disciples reverently prostrated themselves before him and praised the mercy of Gurudeva, which defeats even death itself.

"I understand that the child now belongs to you — you brought him back to life," the mother said, shedding tears of immense joy. "But please tell me, who will belong to my husband and me?"

"He belongs to you as your son," Mahaprabhuji answered, "but his soul will forever burn a single flame for me. However you will also give birth to more children and they will take care of you and your husband."

## [The Blind Muslim Boy](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1540-the-blind-muslim-boy)

A Muslim called Karimbaksh, also lived in this village of Kachras. His nephew had fallen ill with smallpox and lost the sight of his eyes.

Karimbaksh brought the child to Mahaprabhuji and pleaded, "Mahaprabhuji, in the hour of need we trust in your loving-kindness. Please grant sight to the eyes of my nephew, so that his life may be meaningful. Although we are Muslim I am sure you won't turn us away."

"The kingdom of God knows no distinction of caste, race or religion," Mahaprabhuji replied, smiling. "To me you are one of God's children. It matters not whether you are Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Christian or Jew."

He then instructed Karimbaksh to moisten the eyes of his nephew with the juice from the ankara plant. Everyone knows that the juice of this plant is extremely poisonous and creates blindness, not heals it. But the faith Karimbaksh had in Mahaprabhuji’s powers was so strong, that he carried out the instruction without any hesitation.

Immediately the boy's eyesight was restored. Karimbaksh was at a loss to find words to praise Mahaprabhuji, who attracted many faithful devotees among the Muslims after this incident.

## [Lesson for a Goldsmith](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1536-lesson-for-a-goldsmith)

In a village near Khatu, there lived a goldsmith who boasted of being agnostic [1] . He had nothing but contempt for all swamis and yogis .

One day he took part in a wedding procession which happened to pass by Mahaprabhuji's ashram at the time of satsang . Curiosity prompted the goldsmith to stop in and look what was happening. Being agnostic, he also wanted to know the methods by which he imagined Mahaprabhuji deceived people. With this object in mind, he entered the ashram , intending to reproach Mahaprabhuji at the first opportunity.

Mahaprabhuji smiled at him and offered a warm welcome. In that very moment, the mind of the goldsmith completely changed.

"Oh sir, I ask you to permit me to stay with you!" he exclaimed and in his euphoria he immediately wanted to take swami initiation.

The members of his family witnessed this sudden and dramatic change. Being afraid of the situation, they implored Mahaprabhuji to send the goldsmith back home. Mahaprabhuji replied that at this moment there was no possibility of keeping the goldsmith away from the ashram and so advised that he should stay for some time.

"He has reacted intensely to the spirit of this place without being prepared for the experience," Mahaprabhuji explained. "Here he is liberated from all earthly bonds and feels himself in vairagya [2] . But the time has not yet come for him to renounce the outer world, so in three days I will send him back home to you."

After three days the goldsmith had a dream in the early hours of the morning in which he quarrelled with his wife, took a water jug and left home. In the middle of the dream, Mahaprabhuji woke him.

"You are still very much attached to your family and this dream is a sign for you to return. Of course you may come here from time to time, but only when I grant permission."

Mahaprabhuji knew the soul of the goldsmith and so knew that it was still too early for him to take initiation as a swami . For if he failed in gaining a firm foundation in God, he also would have lost the worldly life that he renounced.



[1] agnostic = one who denies the existence of God and the experience of Divine Truth.

[2] vairagya = renunciation of worldly possessions and attachments

## [Relief for the Cattle](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1539-relief-for-the-cattle)

In the village of Kachras an epidemic was affecting the cattle. Day after day many died, causing considerable loss to the farmers. Panic spread through the village because the existing treatments had proven to be utterly useless. In the case of this epidemic there was no relief and the farmers resorted to any possible measure to eradicate that disease, including magic and rituals.

Finally in their despair they turned to Mahaprabhuji for help.

"Merciful Master, please help us to control this epidemic which threatens our very livelihood!"

"You have come very late to seek my help," Gurudeva replied. "However, I assure you that by tomorrow morning the disease will have disappeared."

That whole night the farmers of Kachras fervently prayed that the words of Gurudeva would prove true. In the morning, Mahaprabhuji left his ashram and went with them to a field near the village. I was fortunate to be present at that time.

He stopped in front of a thorn bush and explained that this bush was the source of the epidemic. He directed the farmers to dig a hole three metres deep and to throw the bush in.

"We want to bury this illness once and for all," he said. After this the epidemic disappeared.

With immense gratitude the villagers rejoiced and praised the fame of the merciful and compassionate Gurudeva!

It must be acknowledged that the disease was not the result of that particular thorn bush, otherwise the epidemic could not have disappeared just by burying it. Rather, it was through this action that Mahaprabhuji made it easier for the simple farmers to understand. The epidemic was driven away through nothing else but the Divine power of Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji.

According to the law of karma , everyone is responsible for their own actions and thus their own destiny. This truth complies with the principle or law of "cause and effect": each action has a corresponding reaction. The pleasant and unpleasant effects that arise from our actions can continue throughout many lives but, due to the limitations of our sensory awareness and our memory, we are normally unaware of what karmas are carried with us from previous lifetimes. Be sure that whatever happens in our life today is never due to chance or accident. At any time there are always certain decisive reasons for every event, even if we are unaware of it.

A perfected soul who incarnates on this earth is fully conscious of these diverse cause and effects. That soul not only knows of our karma but can also save us from it by their Divine mercy and blessing. It is beyond doubt that Mahaprabhuji knew the reason for the cattle epidemic in Kachras, but he did not speak of it. Without his intervention this story would certainly have come to a different end. But he who is beyond the winding roads of fate and destiny, bestowed his compassionate mercy.

The main motive for the appearance of such a Divine soul on earth is to bring spiritual purification to all. The Divine incarnation is like the sunrise which brings an end to the night of human ignorance. We are apt to think that we serve those great Saints but in reality it is they who serve us, much beyond the capacity of our limited imagination.

## [The Muslim Fakirs](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1547-the-muslim-fakirs)

Mahaprabhuji was sitting in his room one day when two Muslim fakirs came begging. He rebuked them.

"You shouldn't waste your lives like this. If you want to beg, then beg Allah to satisfy the hunger of your hearts and don't bother about your bellies."

"But Swamiji, it is right for yogis , swamis and fakirs to live by begging," the fakirs answered. "It is a venerable tradition and you ought to be doing it too."

Mahaprabhuji smiled and replied that he did beg, but not as they did. He then taught them and his teaching was a beautiful poetic song in traditional Muslim form:



TUM LAKHON FAKIRON HAM FEERE

O you Fakirs, I am a beggar at the threshold of Heaven, But filled with God's mercy I know no other desire, I make the journey without a vehicle, without taking a step And without a bowl I receive nourishment. There he is the light, indescribable is his play. There exists no breath, no place, no home. There is no heaven or hell, neither hope nor disappointment. Nothing is visible, no form, no Prana. Only the knower of the Vedas can experience that. The swan of my soul flies there without wings through meditation, I met the Supreme Guru who brought me to that Divine place, This is my way of begging.



The fakirs then asked Mahaprabhuji to explain where Allah and the Highest Self could be found. Mahaprabhuji answered that they were one and the same and sang another bhajan to explain.



KHUDA KHUDA KYA KARE KHUDA

Why do you call: Allah! Allah! He is within you and there you must seek him, His radiance shines in every creature Like the reflection of the sun in the water, Be patient in searching for him For he is within you.

Meditate and always sing his name in your heart, Then you may be certain that you will find him, For he is within you in the subtlest form, O, my dears, you will find him!

Consider that in this world nothing and no-one is yours to keep, Realize the unreality of the world and discover that Eternal Truth, it is within you!

My beloved Guru, the Perfect Master, Revealed my inner Self to me, O Fakirs, the Allah and the Self is within you!



Realization was granted to them by Mahaprabhuji's grace and the fakirs , inspired by Divine Truth, bowed down and praised Mahaprabhuji as their Master.

## [A Singer Cured of Arrogance](https://www.lilaamrit.org/divine-grace/1549-a-singer-cured-of-arrogance)

Once a famous singer participated in the satsang of Gurupurnima at Mahaprabhuji's ashram . His singing style filled all present with an enthusiasm beyond measure. Despite his wish to leave the ashram before the celebrations had ended, everyone begged him to stay longer and not deprive them of the great fortune of listening to his beautiful voice.

But the arrogant singer refused their request.

"My time is valuable," he exclaimed. "For just a single song I earn 100 rupees in town. I only came here to greet Mahaprabhuji and do not intend to stay longer."

On hearing this, Mahaprabhuji said to him, "Dear Panditji, they all ask you to stay and they speak with the voice of their soul. It would be a mistake to refuse their wish and the Omnipresent would not be pleased."

However, the singer was unwilling to heed the warning of Mahaprabhuji and he left the ashram with his son. The other visitors were sad.

"O Mahaprabhuji, our hearts long to hear the beautiful voice of Panditji singing bhajans ."

Mahaprabhuji comforted his devotees.

"In the kingdom of Gurudeva the desires of bhaktas are always fulfilled. Be sure that Panditji will not go far. He will return and sing for you as long as you wish."

And it happened just as Mahaprabhuji had said, for soon after the singer and his son left the ashram, they became lost. Without noticing it, they walked again and again around the ashram . Despite quickening their pace they gained no distance.

Mahaprabhuji revealed this scene to his devotees.

"Don't speak to them," he said with a smile. "They wanted to leave and now their wish is granted. Later this evening they will return to the ashram ."

Oblivious to their situation, the father and son strode around the ashram acknowledging that they seemed to have covered a great distance. Soon they would be able to see their home village, they thought. But when they sat down to take a rest they suddenly realized that they sat directly in front of the ashram .

Mahaprabhuji's words came to the son's mind.

"You didn't realize who Gurudeva is. He is a Divine incarnation and because you ignored his words this lesson has been given to us."

"Yes, it is true," the pandit answered, amazed. "All that time we have been circling the ashram , but how is it that we saw forests, hills and villages on our way? Where has all that disappeared? All day long we have walked and now we’re back where we started!"

Respectfully they entered the ashram and bowed to Mahaprabhuji.

"Lord, forgive my mistake!" the singer pleaded. "Greed blinded me so that I treated you like a common person. Now my eyes are open to your Divine power. Please be gracious enough to accept us and allow us to sing lifelong only in praise of you."

Mahaprabhuji placed his hands on their heads to bless them but warned them with these words:

"Don't ignore the desires of the bhaktas and your request shall be granted."

On this day the ashram was filled with euphoria and Mahaprabhuji sang the following bhajan in his splendid voice. It left a deep impression on the pandit and his son.



KYA KARATE HO GANA BAJANA

Why do you sing and make music? One who does not realize the grace of the Guru Aimlessly wanders all his life, His farces and plays are without sense, He is like a fool who raises his voice While at the same time covering his ears with his hands.

Blind with illusion and pride, he bows to himself, Playing many instruments and ceremonial trumpets He preaches to others the omnipotence of God Yet in himself this knowledge remains untapped, Only the brave and daring live the truth And that one is like the star in the night sky.

Swami Deep says, my Satguru is Sri Devpuriji Maharaj, The unfathomable fakir, his fame is unequalled.

On this special day of Gurupurnima, Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji appeared in his physical form in different locations at one time.

## [DISCIPLES](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples)

## [Sri Swami Shivananda](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/sri-swami-shivananda)

In the village of Choti Khatu there lived Thakur Sri Balawant Singhji Jodha Rajput. This ruler had only one son, Sri Savai Singhji, who was a brave young man of great strength and keen intelligence. On meeting Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji, the nobleman's son became a faithful and regular visitor to the ashram .

It is said that your nature will develop according to the company you keep. For example, if you associate with drug-takers they will soon pass on their drug habits, but if your companions are holy men, the result is likely to be an increase in your own holiness. And in the presence of a true Saint, the most wonderful things will definitely happen to you. Spiritual awakening and development takes place of its own accord. Liberation begets liberation. All hidden power is revealed and awakened in the disciple through the grace and mercy of the Master.

I must stop here for an aside and ask you to consider one thing. Suppose you think you have discovered the legendary paras [1] stone, with its ability to transform iron into gold. You fetch a piece of iron and touch it with this stone, but nothing happens.

We can draw two conclusions: either the paras stone is not genuine or it was not touched properly. It is just the same situation when meeting a holy person or Master and nothing happens to you in the way of enlightenment, or an awakening. Either the holy person is not a true Master, not perfectly Realized, or else within you there are doubts which hinder contact with that real Master. Blind faith and belief is never demanded of you, instead you must work to improve your inner qualities. Constantly strive to purify yourself. Meditate, pray, serve, think of God and then patiently look for the real results!

So to continue my story, as a result of his virtue and good deeds, Sri Savai Singhji came to meet Mahaprabhuji. The radiance of that Divine Master penetrated so deep into his heart, that immediately he felt the intensity of Divine love and his spirituality was awakened. He realized the transience of this world and was able to attain complete detachment from all worldly pleasures - where all desires of the heart are replaced by a single yearning for union with the Supreme.

It was with great respect but firmness that Sri Savai Singhji spoke to his parents.

"I will no longer be living at home with you, for I wish to renounce the world that I may serve all mankind by showing the true path to those who have lost their way."

"You are our only child," was their shocked reply. "How can you possibly do this to us? Who will carry our family line?"

They were even more distressed because they had already planned the wedding of their son. In India, the role of the eldest son is a very important one and if the son is the only child, he has the responsibility for the continued existence of the whole family and for the care of aged or helpless family members.

"If you have no son to take care of you," Sri Savai Singhji replied gently but firmly, "then you must look to God as your helper, the great protector of all. If you have as much love and attachment for Him as you do for me, then that will be your door to liberation. If it is so important for the family line to continue, then you may rest assured that my uncle will have a son who will take care of the family. You must make your peace with my decision for I will not change my mind. I have promised and I will keep this promise even if it costs my life."

True to his word, Sri Savai Singhji steadily resisted all attempts to interest him in worldly life. Having passed this test of tenacity, he was found worthy to be taken into the sannyas order. On this occasion, a great celebration was prepared and Mahaprabhuji gave initiated him in the traditional sannyas diksha [2] , bestowing a new, spiritual name, Sri Swami Shivananda. Filled with the richness of Mahaprabhuji's grace, he spontaneously offered the following prayer in dedication to Mahaprabhuji:



SRI GURU ATMA MA PARAMATMA

The Atma in everything is Immortal, it is God, O Gurudeva! As this Atma you live in everyone. You are the soul of all creatures, The perfect, pure Atma, the true form, All-embracing as the sky, Meditation upon you opens the eyes To the knowledge of that which has no beginning nor end. The Atma is without limit, Standing beyond everything, it is the Supreme, The Atma is indescribable and Infinite, O Protector of the Bhaktas! Happy are those who can approach him, Above all elements, truly the Supreme dwells among us. All Yogis and Saints meditate upon him To attain the highest bliss, My greatest veneration to you, my Satguru Mahaprabhu Deep! Through your mercy, your devotee can leave behind the burden of the world and cross the ocean of ignorance.

This is Swami Shivananda's prayer to you, O' Omniscient and Omnipresent.

Sri Swami Shivananda had been familiar with yoga since his childhood and so his inner Self was well prepared. As soon as Mahaprabhuji blessed him, he entered samadhi , that transcendent state of consciousness and God-realization where knowledge, the knower and the subject of knowledge unite as one. At that moment when the individual consciousness is merged with the Divine, all worldly suffering and misery naturally falls away and one realizes everlasting joy. The ego is dissolved into the Cosmic One and becomes free from all karma .

Swami Shivananda built himself a small underground cell near the ashram and isolated himself there for one month. He closed himself in and gave specific instructions that no one open the door until they heard him chant OM. Without food or drink he remained there in solitude, in the state of samadhi , also called the breathless state.

After one month the devotees waiting outside heard the sound of OM, which informed them that the yogi's consciousness had again entered this world.

Hundreds of people had gathered and were waiting to receive his blessing when he emerged. Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji opened the door and ordered two disciples to help carry Swami Shivananda out. His body was stiff and he had lost weight, but otherwise he was quite alright. Mahaprabhuji gave him orange juice and after a few days some milk and the whole grain of wheat. For some time he had to follow a special diet prescribed for such situations and after eight days he regained his original physical strength. Surely this is emphatic proof that it is not by food or drink alone that our lives are sustained!

Swami Shivananda was asked to explain why he had made such a great sacrifice and he answered in one bhajan :



HELI MERI DORA MANA SAM JANA

My brothers, it is extremely difficult to control the mind, It is only possible with the Guru's blessing. The mind moves faster than the swift black snake, Creating many waves and forms, But Gurudeva lives in the lotus of the heart, It is there you should direct the mind — Let the waves break there.

The whole form of the Perfect Self is hidden in the four letters [3] , Without them your vision is clouded by ego And you will see many different things, but not the One.

When Prana and Apana rise and rest at the tenth door, There you will see the Divine One, your true Self, And the flame of your consciousness will pass into The great enlightenment.

I came to this realization through my Satguru, Sri Mahaprabhuji, Swami Shivananda received immortal life through his direct guidance.



Many recognised that Swami Shivananda had attained Self- realization and came to him to ask for instruction. Some asked what "mercy of the Guru " meant and to explain Swami Shivananda sang another bhajan :



ESE HAM GURU GAM SEN BICHARI

The Mercy of my Master I understand like this: He is a tree without roots or branches, laden with sweet fruit.

He is infinite, formless and indescribable, His blossoms show the path of Truth, He is invisible, eternal and unchangeable, A tree covered with blossoms that bear heavenly fruit Beyond human understanding.

Exuding love in all directions He stands alone and grows without water, Beyond origin and emptiness, unfathomable.

Many great souls, wise men and Saints chant his glory.

I found Mahaprabhuji, the perfect, merciful Guru, To realize him means to change yourself.

The Guru is the door to bliss, With his gracious look He revealed the secrets of the Supreme to me.

A visitor who had known Swami Shivananda for many years asked why he had given up his comfortable life to become swami .

"Like a man who leaves his home village to build a house in the city," Shivananda answered with a smile, "I too left my palace to build a house in brahma loka [4] ."

"Where is this house? Please show it to me," the visitor asked and again Swami Shivananda chanted:



BANGALA ME AJABA SURANGA PAYA

I discovered the unique and wonderful abode of my Guru, I saw its radiant brilliance reside in Itself Without sun or shadow, enlightened by Divine Light.

The house is beautiful and priceless, Only a few great souls can find it, Its splendour is indescribable — Not even the Vedas or Puranas can describe it, The sound of OM SO HAM fills this house — Formless, free and transcendent.

Mahaprabhuji, my merciful and perfect Master, Showed me the path to this house, Due to his mercy, Swami Shivananda found the house of Reality.



The listeners understood what Swami Shivananda meant by the house in brahma loka , as material property is but a transient illusion. Many kings and princes, even Buddha, gave up their worldly wealth in order to reach that spiritual abode which is beyond birth and death.



As Swami Shivananda promised, a son was born to his uncle, thus ensuring the continuation of the family line. His name is Sri Raj Singhji and he lives today as a faithful devotee of Mahaprabhuji. Due to the extraordinary happenings within his own family, Swami Shivananda's father was also inspired to begin the practice of yoga. His faith in Mahaprabhuji steadily grew and later he also became a swami . Mahaprabhuji initiated him and gave him the name Sri Swami Sukhdevananda Puri and he became a great siddha yogi . Unfortunately he did not become a swami until very late in his life. One should try to realize one’s spiritual calling earlier.



Swami Shivananda mostly travelled to the province of Uttar Pradesh or to Punjab to spread the teachings of Mahaprabhuji. Once in Jalandhar he participated in a great religious Hindu conference. His lecture left a deep impression on the audience. One particular bhajan stirred the souls of all those present:



ABA JAGO JI BHARAT KE VASI

Friends, wake up!

Why do you sleep so deeply?

You are enveloped in ignorance and do not realize it!

I will tell you the Truth,

Brothers, listen to me:

If you don't follow the precepts of Dharma,

What is the sense of being born as a human?

Do you not feel remorse and shame?

You are the protectors of all creation

And should not be destroyers.

You could be Gods, but you prefer to accompany the devil

— Are you not ashamed of that?

My Satguru, Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji,

Awoke me with his word.

Wake up to the real religion!



In the audience was the esteemed Sri Nityananda, who recognised that a transcendent Divine power had spoken to them through Swami Shivananda.



Dear readers, rarely did Swami Shivananda give long discourses. He only ever answered questions and did that mostly in poetry and bhajans . His songs had their direct source in that origin of all things, God.

To become a swami means to dedicate one's life to realizing the origin of the Universe, to discover the one reality and return to our original spiritual home. Our existence in this world is only momentary, we belong to Eternity. The swami is dedicated to a voyage of inner discovery whose goal is the inner Self, because the Self is the All-Self, Omniscient and Omnipresent. The swami is no longer attached to any one person or family, his responsibility is for all and his home is the whole universe.

Swami Shivananda was once asked where he was from and this was his answer:



ESA HAM SUNA CHETAN KA VASI

My friends, I descended from the void Where there is no birth or death, nor destiny, There where all is blessed, he lives.

Immortal, in the light of the Guru's wisdom, My being exists in nothing and everything, I am without fear, for I live in the grace of my Guru, Fearlessly I unite with Nirguna, In the formless I found the highest goal, I recognized the blessing in the look of my Guru.

The emptiness beyond emptiness is full of Divine existence, Beyond reach of the senses, Beyond intellectual capacity, I saw the Divine Light, The all-embracing eternal Brahman, I saw the invisible brightness, the land of Divine colours.

On seeing this I laughed with joy, This is the land where I belong, This is the play of Divine nature, Through my Guru I realized unity, Without a second, I am one with the universe — All is One.

Sri Deep, the merciful and eternal one, led me to this Divine land, Swami Shivananda took refuge in his Guru And through him attained the Supreme.



"Ah, yes," replied the people with many wise nods. "We under­stand now and are sorry to have bothered you with our ignorance, we are grateful to you. Your parents must feel fortunate to have such a son. Of what caste are you?"

With great compassion, Swami Shivananda looked upon them and smiled.

"I see that you still do not quite understand. One should not prize the scabbard but rather the blade of a sword. It is not the race, caste, or religion of a person that is important, but only his knowledge of Truth. My relatives and forefathers are those who understand the Divine word."

"Why are words so important," the people asked, "and what is the Divine word?"

Swami Shivananda sang:



SABDA SANEHI MERI JATRA MERI HELI

My relatives are those who understand these words, Through words we give and take, We speak, understand and realize through words, Wherever we go, we cannot get there without words, Words bring us together, words unite us, Words raise our consciousness, Through words we become yogis, Through words we achieve wisdom, Through words we are liberated, Words are Brahman and words are Maya,

Swami Shivananda says, Through his Divine words I crossed the ocean.



And so the people came to understand what is written in the Vedas:

NADA RUPA PARABRAHMA - "The Form of the Supreme is Sound."

Swami Shivananda was an excellent musician, an expert player of sitar, tabla, flute and harmonium and he had a magnificent, melodious voice.

He also dedicated his life to work against drug abuse and helped numerous people to free themselves from drug addiction. He was popular everywhere and his fame spread far beyond the borders of Rajasthan.





Swami Akhandananda from Gujarat was a friend of Swami Shivananda. He was going on pilgrimage and invited Swami Shivananda to accompany him.

"Swamiji, we are visiting the holy places of our country and would be pleased if you would join us. Your bhajans would be a great spiritual inspiration and we would benefit from your knowledge."

Swami Shivananda smiled and thanked them for their kind invitation.

"Let’s first consider a moment the significance of making such pilgrimages," he replied. "A place of pilgrimage is where a Saint once lived and people who were privy to his wisdom would visit him there. But today the Saint no longer lives there! If you are really searching for God and not just taking a pious holiday, it makes no sense to travel from place to place, following the physical footsteps of Saints. Only man himself can be pious, not his journey.

"Better that you would retreat to a quiet place and concentrate on God, meditate upon him, for God is where you live! It is said that if you try to Master many things you will lose all, but if you Master one thing you will gain all. Therefore, concentrate on this one thing and you will obtain the blessing of perfection! Look at a tree. Its leaves, branches, blossoms and fruit are sustained by the roots. If you want water to reach the leaves, you must pour it on the roots, otherwise the water will be wasted."

One of the swamis objected.

"But Swamiji, are we not going to the roots by visiting these holy places? Aren't they the source of spiritual inspiration and awakening?"

"No!" replied Swami Shivananda. "Only by devoting oneself to the Guru will the fruit of spiritual practice become ripe. Without Guru bhakti [5] , all is in vain. One who has realized the Self, himself becomes the fragrant flower of divinity. No statue or stone, no matter how revered, can show you the way to this truth, for such monuments are only relics of the Supreme. It is the Saint himself whom you must seek, the Self-realized one who knows the path to God from personal experience. Only a living Master can lead you from the darkness of ignorance ( gu ), to the light of knowledge ( ru ). He is your spiritual Master, your Guru .

"All manifestations of maya are transient and form the empire of ignorance. But the radiance of the Divine Truth shines everlastingly and is unchangeable, in all three chronological dimensions of past, present and future. It is also unhindered by the dimension of space. My friends, when your prayers are heard and you meet the Satguru, you will see that the whole Universe exists within him and that he is everywhere, in everything. You will see that all holy places, all Gods and all Saints are within him. If you find him, you will never need to go elsewhere.

"Especially blessed are those who can live with their Guru . Fortunate are they who are allowed to serve him and those who only meet him from time to time and hold him in their thoughts. My friends, to merely enter a bank doesn’t make you rich and visiting places where the wise once lived in days gone by, will not impart wisdom. Truth must be acquired through practice and experience. To find the spiritual treasure of the inner Self, the right key must be found. It is the Guru who possesses this key."

Then Swami Shivananda sang another bhajan :



GURU CHARANO ME ADASATA TIRATHA HAIN

All scriptures proclaim that the true pilgrim's goal Is the place where the Guru lives.

There the true disciples gather to bathe In the sacred stream of knowledge, There the experienced ones come to convey their wisdom.

There all wishes of the aspirants are fulfilled And they reach their aim of self realization, Liberated from birth and death, they unite with the Supreme.

Praise to Gurudeva Mahaprabhu Deep!

How thankful is Swami Sivananda that he finds completeness there.



Swami Akhandananda and the other pilgrims abandoned their journey and spent many blessed days in inspirational satsang with Swami Shivananda, for whom they felt a great veneration.

For many years Swami Shivananda taught the truth through lectures and satsang , bringing people to the right path. His most beautiful bhajans are collected in a book titled Sri Shivananda Vani Prakash .

At the end of his earthly existence, he took leave of his physical body through the power of yoga and in accordance with the Divine will, united with the Supreme Consciousness.

## [Siddha Yogi Sri Shankar Puriji](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/siddha-yogi-sri-shankar-puriji)

Sri Samrat Singh, son of Sri Svarup Singh of Bola Guda in the Pali district of Rajasthan, was a powerful and feared member of the Indian aristocracy. He was egotistical and proud of his friendship with the Maharaja of Jodhpur. He had a bad temper and was cruel, frequently ordering people to be beaten without trial. Scornful of everything related to religion, he couldn't bear the company of sadhus , priests or swamis and maintained that their only aim was to deceive and rob the people.

Once the youngest brother of Mahaprabhuji, Swami Hari Ram Puri came to preach at Bola Guda because he heard that the Maharaja there, Sri Ram Singh, was a pious man. Ram Singhji warmly welcomed the swami and invited him to stay in the village to hold satsang .

"I will be happy to stay here," agreed Swami Hari Ram Puri, "but I will not sleep in the village itself."

So they built him a thatched straw hut near the village wall, such as the farmers live in, under a large and shady tree.

Swami Hari Ram Puri frequently came to the village to visit the Maharaja and one day was holding satsang at the palace when Sri Samrat happened to arrive there. Angrily he interrupted the satsang .

"What kind of spectacle are you staging here?" he shouted at the swami . "You don't belong in this place. If you want to pray to God then do it in the jungle where you belong with all the other sadhus and stop cheating these simple village folk!"

Threateningly he advanced towards Swami Hari Ram Puri. All those present became frightened and made a hasty escape. Thakur Ram Singhji knew that Samrat Singh was not amenable to any argument while in such a mood and so he remained quiet. Therefore the swami had no other choice but to leave and return to his hut.

Shortly thereafter the swami left Bola Guda and went to Khatu, where he complained bitterly to Mahaprabhuji about the treatment he had received.

"If we must tolerate insults and abuse even though we have a Divine protector like you among us, then how will the sanctity and dignity of the holy, orange robe be preserved?"

" Swamis and yogis must remain unmoved by insults and praise alike," Mahaprabhuji answered.

He went on to quote the words of Lord Krishna from The Bhagavad Gita (Ch. 12, V. 18-19):

"Equally he loves friend and enemy. He remains calm in honour or humiliation, in heat or cold, pleasure or pain. He is free from the fetters of attachment. For him rebuke and praise are equal. He can control his words, he is content with everything that he receives. He is at home everywhere and nowhere. His thoughts are only directed to Me and his heart is ever faithfully devoted. That one who so lovingly worships Me, is dear to Me!"

"What you have suffered was nothing," Mahaprabhuji continued. "Think of what Christ had to bear. Even on the cross He prayed to God for the forgiveness of his tormentors. You should not care for the fruits of your work nor for the response of people, no matter if pleasant or unpleasant. Remain perfectly dedicated to your belief and to your duty, for it is also written in the Gita :

"'It is better to fulfil one's own dharma imperfectly than to fulfil the dharma of another so perfectly. It is better to die in fulfilling one's own dharma but it is dangerous to follow the dharma of another'." ( The Bhagavad Gita , Ch. 3, V. 35)

Smiling at Swami Hari Ram Puri, he added, "But if you want, I can easily make that disrespectful man your disciple."

"Oh no!" Swami Hari Ram Puri quickly replied. "Not that devilish one! I have no desire for such disciples! But I would be very pleased if he would become a follower of yours."

That year Mahaprabhuji spent the months of the monsoon in Jodhpur. He held large satsangs there. Soon the whole city came to know of his presence, including Sri Samrat Singh, who decided to go and see what new fraud this famous yogi was perpetrating.

In this frame of mind he arrived at one of Mahaprabhuji's satsangs and saw hundreds of people sitting there.

"First I shall sit with the others and hear what this alleged mahatma has to say," he thought, "and then I will chase him away once and for all!"

For his part, Mahaprabhuji had immediately noticed this particular addition to his audience and had no difficulty in perceiving the thoughts and feelings of his arrogant guest. He sent Sri Samrat Singh a look of infinite kindness. The heart of the angry fighter immediately began to melt like snow under the blazing sun. Divine Light filled his soul and in one moment he was completely changed. His thoughts stood still for a few endless seconds and his soul dived deep into the bliss of divine peace.

"My God, I have wasted my entire life gathering a bundle of sins," he thought with black despair when his thoughts returned with a rush.

At that moment he vowed to take shelter in the protection of Mahaprabhuji, so as to give his life new meaning.

After satsang ended and people began to leave, Mahaprabhuji approached Sri Samrat Singh.

"Hadn't you better quickly leave here? Are you not afraid that you will be led astray like all the others?" he innocently teased.

With great humility, Samrat Singh replied, "The moment I saw you the devil of arrogance left me and it is gone forever. For the first time in my life I feel at peace with myself. I need your help and protection! As your humble devotee, I beg you to grant me atma - gyana , knowledge of the Divine Self. A strong longing to renounce the world has awakened in my heart. Please be so merciful and make me a swami !"

Mahaprabhuji pretended to be surprised.

"My dear friend, what has happened to you? I thought you believed all swami’s to be swindlers."

"Gurudeva!" Samrat Singh beseeched, "Only you know what has happened to me! Nothing of it can be described in words."

"Well, it will be as you wish," Mahaprabhuji responded, "but first you must return home and explain to your wife what you wish to do. If she agrees and comes here to give me her consent, I will then guide you in the renunciation of this world and initiate you as swami . Husband and wife are two halves of one whole, therefore they should always act in harmony and mutual understanding. Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto Truth and direct your thoughts to God."

Sri Samrat Singh hurried home and demanded his wife to come and tell Mahaprabhuji she had no objection in his becoming a swami . The patient and dutiful Srimati Suraj Kunwar looked at her husband in bewildered silence, as she doubted she had heard him correctly.

Once again anger flashed in Samrat Singh.

"Come on! Hurry up, otherwise . . ." (which goes to show how old habits die hard).

Meanwhile, Srimati Suraj Kunwar had recovered herself.

"Are you making some joke or are you telling the truth? You must explain why you, having always treated representatives of religion with such indescribable contempt, now wish to become a swami himself. I’m totally confused and cannot understand your sudden change of mind."

With a patience that he had never before exhibited, Samrat Singh answered her.

"It is true and not at all a joke, my dear wife. It is the Divine work of Gurudeva, for with one single look he can change any person. I have met a truly Divine Master. He has filled my inner void with Light and liberated me from the darkness of sin."

Of course he could not refrain from impatiently adding, "So now hurry up and come give your consent."

Srimati Suraj Kunwar accompanied her husband to Mahaprabhuji. Being a deeply religious woman, she prostrated herself with complete devotion before him and asked what he wished her to do.

"My sister if you want, leave Samrat Singh with me and from this day forward he will become an immortal son of the heavenly father," Mahaprabhuji said.

Humbly she agreed and requested that Mahaprabhuji initiate her husband as a swami .

You may think that Srimati Suraj Kunwar was relieved to be rid of such a husband, but despite his harsh nature she had loved him and it was only her greater love of God that enabled her to release him. She did make one request to Mahaprabhuji for herself: that she should be able to see her husband from time to time after he had become a swami .

"After his initiation, he will return to Bola Guda and you will be able to see him at every satsang ," Mahaprabhuji promised her. "He will live in the thatched hut outside the village which was built for Swami Hari Ram Puri."

Mahaprabhuji blessed them both and instructed Sri Samrat Singh to put his affairs in order and make arrangements for his wife to be properly provided for without him. Furthermore, he announced that Samrat Singh's initiation ceremony would be held some weeks later in Pushkar, a famous place of pilgrimage near Ajmer.



Soon after these events, Mahaprabhuji left Jodhpur and returned to Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram. He had not been there for many days when his Guru , Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji appeared in the ashram .

"You must go and be initiated as paramhansa by Bhagwan Sri Shankaracharya, head of the Shringery Matha order," he said. "He is staying at Pushkar and this is the time to do it."

" Paramhansa " is the highest spiritual title that can be bestowed on a disciple by the Guru or leader of his order. The literal meaning of paramhansa is "Supreme Swan." The swan is a sacred symbol in Hinduism and carrying this title indicates that the bearer has Realized the Highest Self within. The swan is symbolic of the soul which, when completely detached and free from the bonds of worldly life, rises to God to unite with Him.

Shankaracharyas are the heads of the swami order in India. There are four such orders, one in each quarter of India. These four divisions are called mathas or ashrams and every swami belongs to one of them. The four Mathas are Shringery, Gowardhan, Jyotir and Sarda.

Mahaprabhuji, whose renown by this time had spread throughout India, did as Sri Devpuriji commanded and made all preparations for the ceremony. Some of the greatest spiritual leaders were invited, including the Shankaracharya of Puri and his Holiness, Mahamandaleshwar Acharya Sri Krishnanandji.

When the time came, Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji travelled with Samrat Singh and other devotees to Pushkar, where they stayed in the Temple of Brahma. The sacrificial fire ceremony was performed by his Holiness Shankaracharya and the title of Paramhansa was bestowed on Mahaprabhuji. On the same occasion, Sri Samrat Singh was initiated as sannyasi by Mahaprabhuji and given the name Sri Swami Shankar Puriji.

Dear readers, as I write this it occurred to me that a question might arise why it is necessary for a Divine incarnation like Maha­prabhuji to receive the title of Paramhansa. You may recall the first meeting between Sri Devpuriji and Mahaprabhuji, where Sri Devpuriji explained that while he and Mahaprabhuji were in reality one and the same, they had to enter the relationship of Master and disciple according to the laws as set by God. Take the example of those before them, as Lord Rama with Guru Vashista and Sri Devpuriji himself with his Guru Sri Alakh Puriji. Great Saints establish and maintain these ceremonies and relationships, not because they themselves need them, but because they are useful examples for ordinary men. They provide an example for the rest of us to follow.

Another reason is that one never extols one’s own achievements. If you wish to be accepted in the academic world you cannot merely declare yourself a doctor. Rather, you must successfully pass examina­tions and allow the university faculty to award you the appropriate degree. It was the same with Mahaprabhuji’s spiritual title. With true humility, he allowed the world to show its respect by bestowing the title of paramhansa . At the same time this was an official proclamation to announce his God Realization, so that all spiritual seekers may know of his Oneness with God.

After they had been together for some time, Mahaprabhuji sent Swami Shankar Puriji to Bola Guda.

"Make yourself at home in the hut of Swami Hari Ram Puri and then build an ashram there. Do not go anywhere else - continue your meditation and spiritual development. In that place you will attain perfection and Realize your Self."

The ashram that Swami Shankar Puriji built is called Shivbagh [1] and Mahaprabhuji often stayed there.

His arrival back in Bola Guda caused a sensation in the whole area due to his sudden transformation from a despised and tyrannical overlord, into a humble and holy swami . Many came to visit the new swami and all were impressed by his comprehensive knowledge and wisdom. Soon satsang was held in the ashram of Bola Guda each day.





Near Bola Guda Ashram was a pond called Shyam Talab, on whose banks dwelt many beautiful song birds and water birds. One day Swami Shankar Puriji's nephew, Thakur Jorawar Singh from Khivanda, came to visit with a hunting party.

First he went to pay his respects to his uncle.

Swami Shankar Puriji blessed him and asked, "What brings you here?"

"I have come with some friends for a bird hunt," Jorawar Singh answered.

Immediately Swami Shankar Puri called his nephew's attention to the principle of ahimsa and gave a stern warning that could not be misinterpreted.

"For as long as I live here, there will be no hunting at this lake!"

But Jorawar Singh was not to be dissuaded so easily.

"No-one can stop me from going on this hunt, not even you, my uncle! Whoever tries to stand in my way will come to know of my power. Don't forget that in former times you also hunted and killed many animals!"

"At that time I was blinded by ignorance," Swami Shankar Puri answered, "but Gurudeva has illumined my heart and removed the veil of ignorance. I now neither hunt nor permit others to do so."

He used every possible means to sway his nephew's resolve but Jorawar Singh did not relent. For three days they quarrelled and reasoned without result. Finally Swami Shankar Puri showed his old furious nature.

Jorawar Singh became frightened.

"I believed that as a swami my uncle had forsaken his fits of rage, but it seems he has remained as before," he thought to himself. "What shall I do now?"

At this time Mahaprabhuji was staying in the nearby village of Mehraji-ka-Guda and Jorawar Singh paid a visit to him there.

"Your disciple Sri Shankar Puriji forbids me to hunt birds at the lake," he complained. "Please tell him he shouldn't interfere in my affairs."

Mahaprabhuji called Swami Shankar Puri to him and said, "Shankar, don't try to stop Thakur Jorawar Singh from bird hunting!"

"Gurudeva! I will follow your instructions," Swami Shankar Puriji replied. "Yet please tell me how I can permit him to hunt innocent living beings. I beg you to explain this to me!"

On hearing this exchange of conversation, Jorawar Singh called out, "Mahaprabhuji! I acknowledge your greatness and that of your disciple Shankar Puriji. I will not hunt. I only wanted to test my uncle’s resolve."

His uncle rebuked him, saying, "Whoever has attained the Guru’s grace, shall pass all tests."

Mahaprabhuji pacified them.

"Both of you are really true warriors."

Thus peace was made between them and Swami Shankar Puriji found an upright disciple in his nephew.

Swami Shankar Puriji Maharaj became a great siddha yogi and at the end of his earthly life, passed into eternal samadhi in full consciousness.

## [Satsang on Krishna's Birthday at Bola Guda](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/1562-satsang-on-krishnas-birthday-at-bola-guda)

Mahaprabhuji was staying at the Bola Guda Ashram at the time of Janmashtami festival, the celebration for the occasion of God Krishna's birthday. On this festival the merchant Seth Rup Chandaji from Bhiwalia and his family, as well as Thakur Bhur Singhji and Pandit Jiva Rajaji from Jait Singh Guda, all wanted to go and see Mahaprabhuji.

In the evening they left their homes and travelled by oxcart to Bola Guda. Their way was through a river bed which, though normally dry, was then in flood due to the monsoon. The animals and heavy cart began to sink in the water and be carried along by the strong current. Fearing for their lives, the devotees loudly called to Mahaprabhuji for his help.

"Lord, if you're unable to save us from this river, what hope do we have in crossing the ocean of ignorance? Please don't let us drown in this flood. We are on our way to see you!"

And from the depths of their hearts, together they sang the mantra ,

OM PRABHU DEEP NIRANJAN SABADUKHA BHANJAN

"OM Mahaprabhuji, radiant Light, save us from all evil!"

In this moment a miracle took place. Drawn by an invisible force, the ox and cart safely landed on the opposite shore. Wet and still trembling with the fear of their life-threatening ordeal, the group joined together in a thanksgiving prayer, then continued on their way to see their Divine benefactor.

On arriving at the ashram they wanted to express their thanks to Mahaprabhuji but even before they could say a word, Mahaprabhuji spoke to them with feigned sternness.

"Is this your entire confidence in me? I had always thought that you were firm in your belief, but you are full of fear! I am always with you, so why worry about your life? The cord of life is always in Guru­deva's hands. Only he can save you from every danger."

During the whole night they held a joyous satsang . Inside, the ashram radiated with the warmth of music and devotion while outside the cold monsoon rains tumbled from the sky. When day was breaking the disciples were becoming hungry but the ashram only contained one open fireplace which was impossible to use because of the continual downpour. Some wanted to go to the village to ask for warm food.

Mahaprabhuji perceived these thoughts as if they had been spoken aloud.

"It's not necessary to bother the village citizens. The rain will soon stop for as long as it takes you to cook and eat, then it will return to wash your dishes! I will instruct God Indra not to disturb your meal!"

Instantly it stopped raining around the ashram , while it continued to rain in the village. What a wonderful experience! The lightning and thunder flashed and rolled about them while they cooked and ate their meal without interruption. When finished, they simply left their dishes and, as promised, it began to rain again and the plates were washed clean!





The following day, the richly blessed devotees were preparing to return home when Mahaprabhuji took Pandit Jiva Rajaji aside and asked him to stay one more day.

"I would very much like to do this," answered the pandit , "but unfortunately my duties call me back. As you know, I lead the temple service in our village and have the responsibility to punctually perform the puja [1] . Besides, at the least I also receive my income from this duty."

Mahaprabhuji smiled.

"Don't worry. The spring of your income lies elsewhere. Stay here with me."

Being a faithful disciple, the pandit was unable to refuse the request of his Master and so stayed in Bola Guda.

After one more day of peace at the side of Gurudeva, the pandit returned to his village in the evening. On arriving there he was more than surprised at the question put to him by his neighbours.

"Where did you disappear so quickly after service this morning?"

It was then that the pandit learned that as the people of his village stepped into the temple for morning prayers, he had appeared to them as usual to perform the ceremony and after the puja he was seen by the devotees to close the gates of the temple and leave.

At first he was speechless and he did not answer his neighbours’ question. Gradually it dawned on him what had happened and he realized the truth in the words that God does everything for his devotees. God truly takes upon Himself the full range of responsibility for his wards and even takes their form and carries out their daily tasks.

Pandit Jiva Rajaji told me this story himself. In former times such miracles also took place, as can be seen in the following story.



Sena Bhagat was a barber in the court of a king who suffered from leprosy. It was his task to be in the palace daily at a certain time to shave the king. This king had a cruel nature, but for all that Sena Bhagat was still kind, mild in his character and had selflessly surrendered to God.

One day on his way to the palace the barber met some swamis . Respectfully, Sena Bhagat greeted the holy men and inquired of them whether they had already taken their daily meal, as it is the custom of sadhus , swamis and monks to entrust God and fellow beings with their livelihood. On hearing that the swamis had not yet eaten, Sena Bhagat realized that it was his sacred duty to invite them to his house.

"It would be a great honour for me if you would bless my house by taking your meal with me."

Thus he instantly upset his schedule for the day and guided the swamis to his home, where he served them a rich meal. After this they held satsang . Finally the sadhus thanked their host and continued on their way.

Meanwhile, the barber's appointment with the king had long since passed and Sena Bhagat reckoned that he would certainly be punished. Full of fear, he dashed as fast as he could to the palace without knowing what to say to excuse himself. However, to his great surprise the king received him warmly and even heartily hugged him.

"Please excuse my delay, Oh Lord," Sena Bhagat muttered.

But the king did not hear him at all, for he was saying in joyous excitement, "Which miraculous power do you possess, that while shaving me today I was healed from your touch? You will be amply rewarded!"

What had happened? The Lord Himself had taken on the duty of Sena Bhagat while he was in selfless service to the servants of God. Truly noble is the mind of a bhakta like Sena Bhagat!



In the Shivbagh Ashram of Bola Guda, Mahaprabhuji was visited by a famous Jain acharya [3] named Sadhu Acharya Vijaya Suriji. At first he tried to start a religious dispute but realizing Mahaprabhuji's deep wisdom, he decided to become a disciple.

"True Saints of the Jain are those who renounce the illusion of maya and seek God," Mahaprabhuji spoke. "Truly great souls realize brahma gyana , the knowledge of Brahman. God-realization is not bound to this world and therefore not dependent upon worldly education. Those who place much confidence in intellectual knowledge are often misdirected by maya . God-realization cannot be attained through outward appearances, but only by overcoming inner desires, attachments and mistakes. Whoever recognizes his own Self in the entire universe is a true Jain. He fights against no one and adheres to the Divine command. Ascetic practices without self-analysis only lead to suffering and not to realization. Only this realization of the truth can overcome the harm of the world."

"I have been unwise to doubt my meeting such a Saint of sat sanatan dharma in these times," the Jain Master thought. "Now I realize that Sri Mahaprabhuji is as great as my Master, Bhagwan Mahavir."

Respectfully he spoke to Mahaprabhuji, "I thought that in this age of kali yuga there were no more Divine incarnations, but today you have opened my eyes and I realize that the eternal Divine Light manifests on earth at all times."

"Tell me, is the world during kali yuga different from that during satya yuga , or is it the same?" Mahaprabhuji asked him. The Jain acharya replied, "It is the same."

"Just like the existence of fire, water, the sun and moon," Mahaprabhuji continued, "so too do the God-realized, the mahatmas and rishis of satya yuga manifest on earth during kali yuga in order to revive dharma and protect devotees. In every age Saints and Divine incarnations appear. Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto truth and remember God."

The Jain acharya thanked Mahaprabhuji for this satsang and richly blessed, he returned home.

## [Swami Brahmanand Maharaj - The Master of Music](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/swami-brahmanand-maharaj)

Sri Jethamalji, pandit of Hiyadesar in the district of Bikaner, Rajasthan, had a son by the name of Ganeshmal who was attracted to the spiritual way of life. From early childhood the boy felt drawn to God. His special love was the spiritual songs, bhajans and kirtan s and whenever swamis and sadhus passed through the area, he would go and listen to their satsang . To better understand spiritual literature he decided to study Sanskrit and soon Mastered this beautiful and difficult language.

When Ganeshmal was a little older, he met some wandering yogis and from them learned hatha yoga kriyas [1] , which he practised conscientiously. He then began to live as Brahmacharya, or ascetic and studied the holy texts of The Bhagavad Gita , The Ramayana and The Upanishads . He used to sing bhajans in a sweet and melodious voice and his satsangs would attract numerous people.

One peculiarity he had was the strict observance of certain Vedic regulations where he only ate food prepared by himself. It is said in the scriptures that serious spiritual aspirants should only eat sattvic [2] food, that is, food which has no negative reaction on the body, mind or consciousness. By avoiding certain foods, one experiences an increase in calm­ness and tranquillity, improved harmony between body and mind and a diminution of desires, laziness and animosity.

The person cooking the food is also of great importance because one should cook with great love, repeating a prayer or mantra and concentrating on the thought that one is cooking for God. Then the food becomes holy prasad [3] and transmits love to those who eat it.

If one eats prepackaged and precooked foods, one cannot know who has prepared it and in most restaurants, financial profit is the motive with which the food is prepared. Even in private homes the cook does not necessarily cook with love. But like anything else, these precautions with food can be carried to extremes and Ganeshmalji was certainly guilty of an exaggerated fussiness about what he ate.

Ganeshmalji had many positive characteristics, though. He was intelligent and quick-witted and used to enjoy conversing with scholars. He impressed all with his erudition and could easily win most debates with his nimble mind and eloquence. Finally, through these gifts and talents, he fell into the trap of ego and began arguing and challenging scholars only for intellectual pleasure and with the sole intention of emerging victorious. He also possessed an exceptional hypnotic power, like that of Gumanaram or the snake charmer, with which he could make people unconscious. Through the misuse of these abilities he managed to injure many people and inflict grave injustices.

Ganeshmalji also made the common error of blaming his increasing feelings of emptiness on the era in which he lived, that is, kali yuga . He believed that in this age there were no more real Guru s or yogis . Nevertheless he maintained his devotion to Lord Krishna and often wept in secret at his separation from God as one spouse weeps for the other who is gone.

One day he was resting under a tree in one of the little groves that grow between the villages in Rajasthan and there he dreamed that Lord Krishna stood before him holding a book in his hand and saying, "The author of this book is an incarnation of me."

In the dream, Ganeshmal could see the book's title, Sri Deep Puri Anubhava Prakash ( The Light of Experience) , by Deep Puri, or Mahaprabhuji.

On waking he sat thinking, trying to make sense of the strange dream. He knew that dreams are often only fantasies but, on the other hand, they can also contain deep meaning and truth. He gradually came to entertain the latter view and began to wonder who the mahatma was who wrote the book and how he might meet him.

"I will keep my eyes open and if I should meet this man I shall carefully test him with my intellect and powers lest I be deceived," he finally decided.

But time passed and Ganeshmalji soon forgot about his extraordinary dream and continued his life as before.

Ganeshmalji had relatives in the Pali district in the village of Pilauni and he went there on one occasion to pay them a visit. At that time Mahaprabhuji was staying in Shivbagh Ashram in Bola Guda, which was only about ten kilometres away. By chance, Ganeshmalji met one of Mahaprabhuji's disciples in Pilauni and, while in their home, he idly browsed through their bookshelves. Suddenly he read the title, Sri Deep Puri Anubhava Prakash and it seemed oddly familiar.

He asked his host about the author of the book and this was the answer.

"The author is Mahaprabhuji, our blessed Guru , a supreme Master and Incarnation of Light. You can meet him if you like, for he is just now staying in an ashram not far from here."

All at once Ganeshmalji remembered his dream and he could hardly wait to meet Mahaprabhuji. As was his habit, he began preparing questions and arguments to test the Guru's intellect but not before he had used his hypnotic power on him. With a group of others he soon set out for Shivbagh Ashram.

When they arrived, Mahaprabhuji was sitting among his followers and Ganeshmalji, neglecting all customary forms of polite greeting, planted himself before Mahaprabhuji and fixed the Saint with his most intensive hypnotic stare.

Mahaprabhuji's gracious smile did not flicker.

"Your ignorance masks quite formidable gifts, my son," he murmured.

Mahaprabhuji returned Ganeshmal's look. Ganeshmal's power was reflected upon himself and he slithered to the ground, quite unconscious of the external world. The onlookers drew back in surprise, some afraid that Mahaprabhuji had also used magic powers, but naturally this was not so. Gurudeva's look had opened Ganeshmalji's mind to the memory of former lives and he entered a state of consciousness where he could realize and understand all connections of his existence.

On opening his eyes, he bowed low before Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji and said, "Lord, in my former life I met you as Lord Krishna and today all my dreams have come true!"

He then began to sing:



HARI GURU MILIYA THA PURABA ME

I have met this Divine Master in previous times But I didn't recognise him, Full of problems, I was asleep in ignorance.

I didn't know that today I would meet God, How could I see him coming When my inner Self was not clean?

It was full of sin, deluded, preoccupied. O Lord, the ocean of problems is deep — let me cross! O Lord, through many births have I wandered in ignorance But now the Lord has called me with So Ham, Merciful Prabhu Deep has accepted me into his kingdom.

Through loving him I have become one with him, Brahmananda says: Now I am a realized being and will come no more to birth.

Mahaprabhuji touched his arm.

"Get up, my dear son and don't lament what is past. You are a part of my inner Brahma and so from today on, you will be known as Sri Swami Brahmananda."

The newly initiated swami raised his sweet voice in prayer:

OM NAMO GURU DEEP AVINASI

I salute you, OM, immortal Guru Deep! You are Brahma, you are Vishnu, you are Shiva, You are Narada! You are the meditator, the wise, the Light of Yoga, You are the liberated one, the Omnipresent, You have the knowledge of the Vedas, You are the preacher of the Truth And the knower of the Divine Name, I salute you, Divine Master, Guru Deep! Your place is forever in my heart and consciousness.



Mahaprabhuji was pleased by this lovely prayer and he made a prediction.

"My son Brahmananda, you will be famous as the Master of Music (Sangitacharya). Among thousands of singers you will be the best! No one will be able to resist your song. Even the hardest hearts you will melt in infinite bliss!"

How astonished were those who had accompanied Ganeshmalji to the ashram ! They praised his good karma that had allowed the Divine power to awaken in him so suddenly.

Ganeshmalji sang another bhajan :



ME SARANAGATA HUN GURUDEVA

Gurudeva, I bow before you, You showed me your true pure form and perfect Light, You are pure consciousness, before which darkness flees, Calling your name dispels difficulties and obstacles, The sun of eternal knowledge rises in your presence, He who meditates on you will be freed from ignorance And will attain bliss.

Ganeshmalji, now Sri Swami Brahmananda, stayed with Mahaprabhuji. He had entirely lost the urge for intellectualising and for destructive criticism. He no longer quarrelled and there was an end to his egotism. He even gave up his insistence on self-cooked food, living simply and humbly in perfect contentment and in constant intoxication of bliss.

His relatives thought that the change which had come over him was most sudden and peculiar and so he explained it with the following song:



PREM KA BAN MERE SATAGURU DINA HE

My Satguru shot the arrow of love, Through his words the hidden gold-mine of knowledge opened And I realized the treasure of my true Self, Now I am filled with immovable bliss and harmony, I am dwelling in the sphere of fearlessness, The light of Brahman was laid into my heart And thus I gained self realization. Filled with light, freed from duality Now my inner Self is dyed the colour of Satguru Sri Devpuriji And Prabhu Deep Dayal, How happy Brahmananda is that he has realized fearlessness.

The question of how it was possible for him to compose and sing his bhajans at the same time he answered also with a bhajan :

ESA MERA SATAGURU ANDARA BOLE

It is my Satguru who speaks through me, He who is without form, immortal and pure consciousness, Who banishes all doubts.

He who is eternal, immovable, his grace is limitless, One who meditates on him day and night, Whoever observes Mauna [4] and concentrates on their breath They realize their Self in him, The Omnipresent, perfect, pure Divine Light — infinite like the ocean, His temple is in your heart and there you can hear his voice.

Through the merging of Prana and Apana Everlasting peace and perfection is achieved, OM rings out from the Manipur Chakra And So Ham becomes one with the breath, In Sunyakash you see the Supreme, There where the rivers merge you attain the unattainable And become Master of your Self.

Swami Brahmananda says, I met the perfect Satguru, Mahaprabhu Deep, through his grace I experienced the highest bliss.

In this way, Swami Brahmananda explained that his gifts and talents came from the blessing of Gurudeva.

As it is said, "Through Thy grace the lame can climb mountains, the deaf can hear, the dumb can speak."

The temple of Gurudeva is in the heart chakra and this opens through the grace of the Guru . One who has truly recognised the Guru as dwelling in his heart has entered upon the path of perfection. Awakening and activating the other chakras results in higher states of consciousness.

But of the thousands who know the Satguru, only a few really recognise him, really know him as that One dwelling in their hearts.

"Where is the true Guru ?" many ask. "Where can he be found?"

Swami Brahmananda's answer is this:

SADHO BHAI MERA SATAGURU MUJ MAHI

Brothers, my Guru is within me! He is all-pervasive, what else do you want to know? He is Omnipresent like the sky, he is perfect purity But without devotion you will miss him, What more shall I explain? Knowledge from books is limited But the Satguru is immortal wisdom — This is explained in the Gita, Brahmananda says: Reverence to my Gurudev Sri Deep Dayal.

Sri Swami Brahmanandji's bhajans are collected in a book called Brahmananda Vani Prakash ( The Light of Brahmananda's Words ). At the end of his life he had foreknow­ledge of his death and entered the mahasamadhi of immortality. His name is a light that will always shine on this earth, like the sun and the moon.

## [Last Visit to the Holy Mother](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/1564-last-visit-to-the-holy-mother)

In Shivbagh Ashram, Mahaprabhuji suddenly stopped in the middle of his satsang speech and closed his eyes for some minutes, turning his vision inwards.

"I must immediately go to Hari Vasani," he spoke. "My mother will soon take her leave of this world and she is waiting for me. Twelve years ago I promised to be with in her last hour."

Before the devotees could grasp the meaning of his words, Mahaprabhuji was already walking out of the ashram to begin his journey. Many hurried to accompany him to the railway station and some, including Sri Swami Shankar Puriji, travelled with him.

At the railway station of Bari Khatu they were greeted by Thakur Revat Singh and many other devotees, who had received the message of his forthcoming arrival. Happy to be blessed by his presence after such a long time, they instantly demanded a satsang and on hearing his nectar-filled words, the people felt refreshed, like a dry garden on which rain has fallen after a long drought.

"I must go to see my mother now," Mahaprabhuji then gently said to them. "She is thinking of me with each breath. I had promised to be at her side when she leaves this world, which will happen the day after tomorrow.

"Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto truth and remember God!"

All present at the satsang accompanied him to the town of his birthplace, Hari Vasani, five kilometres away. There they were met by more bhaktas and all together they made their way to Mahaprabhuji's family home.

It was a solemn atmosphere as he stepped before his mother.

"My greetings to Thee, Holy Mother."

On seeing her Divine son, Srimati Chandan Deviji's eyes filled with tears of joy.

"What a blessing for me that you have come. Now I am free from all burdens and sorrows."

Folding his hands, Mahaprabhuji spoke.

"Mother, if you have a wish, please let it be known to me."

"How can any wish remain in my heart when I have a son like you? Your mere existence is fulfilment of all my wishes," she replied.

Food was prepared for the hundreds of people and the whole day and night were one continuous satsang , filled with music, prayer and song. On the following day, in the early hours of brahma-muhurta , the Holy Mother looked upon her son.

"Hari Hi Om! [1] May my soul enter into your Divine world so that I will forever be with you."

Her soul took leave from this world to forever unite with God.

The devotees reverently offered the traditional prayer for the soul of the departed and then Srimati Chandan Deviji's body was carried away on a flower-decorated bier. She was cremated according to custom on a traditional Vedic funeral pyre. Satsang continued for several days more.

What are our duties to our parents? Mahaprabhuji used to say that we should always honour, obey and respect them, for it is they who gave us human life. As they have brought us into the world and provided for our needs when we were small and helpless, we must thank them lifelong with loving care and devotion. Growing up, we should honour and esteem them and when we are adults we should give them all that they require.

And what of a parent's duty? The book of the Jains, Ratan Sar , teaches that only those who can raise children according to spiritual laws should bring children into the world. Giving children love, they must also respect them as independent personalities! Educate them in the principles of freedom, tolerance and spirituality and awaken in them the yearning for God-realization. If this is neglected purposefully, or through ignorance, it is a grave injustice to bring a soul to human life.



[1] Hari Hi Om , usually shortened to Hari Om , is a form of salutation meaning "God is Om."

## [Thakur Bhur Singh and Gumanaram](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/thakur-bhur-singh)

In the village of Maharamji ka Guda lived a man of unusual powers named Gumanaram, who was known throughout the land for his ability to materialise objects. He could materialise whatever he desired from far distances and this ability had brought him some prominence. Often, though, he would simply force someone by means of threat or blackmail to pro­vide whatever he demanded. He was very proud of his extra­ordinary talent and was utterly convinced of his own impor­tance. His pride, haughtiness and arrogance grew day by day.

Once a great tantric baba came to see Gumanaram. This baba was also well known and had mighty powers of his own. Soon they both quarrelled about who was the greater and the altercation grew more and more passionate. Suddenly Gumanaram transfixed the baba to his seat with a magic formula and the baba grew alarmed when he realized that he could not get up. He tried and tried, but in vain. Finally he had to concede defeat and acknowledge Gumanaram's superiority. Disdainfully, Gumanaram released his opponent and the baba fled as fast as he could.

Gumanaram delighted in such encounters and he parti­cu­larly enjoyed humiliating yogis and sadhus . As his reputation grew, people feared him more and more and he began to believe that he was invincible.

The Ruler of Maharamji ka Guda was Thakur Bhur Singhji, a close companion of Gumanaram. They spent much time together feasting, eating meat and consuming wine and opium.

However, one day the thakur met Mahaprabhuji and decided at once to change his way of life. When he begged Mahaprabhuji for mantra diksha , Mahaprabhuji promised it to him only on the condition that he completely give up hunting, eating meat, drinking alcohol and taking drugs. Thakur Bhur Singhji promised.

Returning home that day full of enthusiasm, he told his friend Gumanaram about his meeting with Mahaprabhuji.

"I have met one who is truly highly developed and in him I glimpsed Divine power and a radiance emanating from absolute purity. When I saw him my eyes were dazzled by his brilliance and time appeared to stand still. I suddenly realized how much more there is to life than I had thought and how much time I've wasted in senseless activities. Without delay I begged him to accept me as his disciple and bestow on me a mantra ."

Gumanaram was shocked.

"Sir! After all, you are an educated and rational man! How could you fall for something like that? Undoubtedly this supposed Saint has hypnotised you and now you are enslaved to him! I don't believe in holy men. Besides, I surpass them all in the powers they claim to possess. I can give you whatever you want just by waving my hand. What Guru can do that?"

Thakur Bhur Singh could only suggest that Gumanaram go and convince himself what this Guru was like.

"Let us depart at once and I'll test this Saint with my powers and see what he can do," the proud magician replied.

They set off at sunset for Mahaprabhuji's ashram at Bola Guda, some twelve kilometres away. It was the time of monsoon and at the village of Kharda they had to cross a rain-swollen river. The banks were very muddy and Gumanaram slipped and injured his right leg.

"Blast this holy man of yours!" he shouted, enraged. "Why in the world am I going to such trouble for him? You'd think he was going to show me heaven and hell the way I'm killing myself to get to him!"

Eight kilometres away at the ashram , Mahaprabhuji was conducting satsang around ten o'clock in the evening when he interrupted it and told some disciples to prepare a certain tincture of herbal medicine.

"One of my disciples who still wallows in ignorance, is coming tonight to see me. During a fall he has hurt his leg and without quick treatment this leg will give him problems for the rest of his life."

The disciples thought all this to be very strange but they followed Mahaprabhuji's instructions and prepared the tincture.

In due time the two men arrived at the ashram , Gumanaram looking a little the worse for wear but still maintaining his belligerent attitude. Standing aside, he watched as Sri Bhur Singhji bowed to Mahaprabhuji. Mahaprabhuji welcomed them both and turned to Gumanaram.

"Greetings, my son. Heaven and hell you wanted to see? This will come later, but for now you ought to take this tincture and rub it into your right leg and rest for a while."

"Sir, you are mistaken. I am not injured," Gumanaram replied.

Gurudeva only smiled at him.

"Dear one, this is the kingdom of truth and you will find it difficult to lie here. You fell down the river bank at Kharda and spoke these words to your friend."

Mahaprabhuji repeated word for word what Gumanaram had said there, then continued.

"Now don't lose any time in taking this medicine if you don't want to have real troubles with your leg."

Mahaprabhuji quoting his own words had the effect like a splash of icy cold water on Gumanaram.

"How can he possibly know this?" he thought. "Bhur Singh could not have told him because we've been together the whole time. It must be a trick, but I can't see how he pulled it off."

While rubbing his leg with the herbal tincture, Gumanaram reflected on this question but could find no answer. Tired from all the excitement and long journey, he lay down and soon fell asleep and began to dream.

Gumanaram was in hell, surrounded by devils, demons, snakes and other frightening beings. He felt unspeakable agony, terror and darkness. He saw the suffering that he had caused others and what painful karma he had created for himself. Gumanaram was caught by bitter repentance.

At two o'clock in the morning he awoke from the dream and saw Gurudeva still sitting with his disciples having satsang . With a groan he lay back and dreamed again.

This time he was in heavenly paradise. In ecstasy he heard the devas and gandharvas singing and he saw the Divine Play. Amidst the eternal bliss of the liberated ones, his inner Self was filled with light, love, harmony, truth and peace. He realized that if he followed Gurudeva his future path would be like this.

At five o'clock in the morning he again opened his eyes. Mahaprabhuji and his disciples were still sitting together in satsang , filled with the joy of a night spent in spiritual unity.

Gumanaram rose and stepped forward before Mahaprabhuji. His leg was completely healed and one might think that he had seen enough marvels to change him, but his ego was not yet convinced. He began to direct all his magic energy towards Mahaprabhuji. He used all his strength but nothing happened. Ultimately he gave up and wordlessly sat down.

Mahaprabhuji, who had apparently ignored him, knew exactly what he was up to and smiled.

"Are you all finished now? Your magic may indeed be effective elsewhere, but how can darkness defeat the sun?"

Gumanaram looked into Mahaprabhuji's kind eyes and recognised in him his Master.

"I've been searching for him all my life without really knowing it," he said to himself. "He is my saviour and it's about time that I surrendered to him."

With folded hands he implored Mahaprabhuji, "Lord, grant your blessing on this poor sinner. Accept me as your child and show me the right way. I know in my heart that you have come into the world to bring light. Please illuminate my darkness."

Sri Mahaprabhuji, the saviour of all living beings, whose mercy and love are infinite, forgave everything. Anger, dislike and feelings of revenge had no place in his Divine heart.

"I will accept you," he told the magician, "but I am placing conditions. Leave behind all your unholy practices, all your magic formulas and tricks with which you used to frighten, cheat and humiliate people. You must cease killing and devouring animals for your own pleasure and you must give up alcohol and drugs. Discard your bad habits and free yourself from negativity!"

Gumanaram humbly bowed.

"Gurudeva, I vow to follow you forever and with your help I will become a new man."

"I will help you find a way to earn an honest living," Mahaprabhuji said. "But you must stick to it and not revert to your old practices. Otherwise, I warn you, the consequences will be dreadful. I think you know what I mean."

He was referring of course to Gumanaram's dream of hell and Gumanaram understood very well.

"Now go and begin your life anew," said Mahaprabhuji.

With a feeling of immeasurable gratitude, Gumanaram left the presence of Gurudeva.



Some time later, Thakur Bhur Singh decided to invite Mahaprabhuji to spend the months of the monsoon in his residence. The invitation was accepted and Mahaprabhuji was received there in splendid festivity. The whole village participated in the celebration and satsangs . All were happy for the opportunity to serve Gurudeva, especially Gumanaram, who had become a farmer and had learned to live with love and respect for his fellow beings.

That year his field was well cultivated and promised a good crop, but suddenly the rains stopped. Alarmed at this, Gumanaram appealed desperately to Mahaprabhuji for help.

"Lord, it has not rained for many weeks, what are we to do? My field is withering and I'm afraid that this year I'll be unable to feed my family. In your vast mercy I beg you to make it rain or else allow me to once again make use of my powers."

Mahaprabhuji smiled kindly.

"Under no circumstances should we let you slide back into your old ways, Gumanaran. God is gracious! Go immediately to your field and call out three times, 'O Lord of Khatu, please send rain'! If you call like this precisely three times, you will receive as much rain as you need."

Without a second's delay, Gumanaram ran to his field.

"God of Khatu, please send rain!" he shouted three times.

In his enthusiasm, he shouted it two more times and looked up into the sky full of hope. He thought that he could see some small clouds to the north and so, just to be sure, he once more invoked the God of Khatu. Immediately a torrential downfall began. Water fell from the sky in such a mass that Gumanaram's field was flooded and it looked as though his crop would be washed away.

Poor greedy Gumanaram! In panic he dashed back to Mahaprabhuji crying for help.

Mahaprabhuji looked at him sternly.

"I gave you exact instructions to call three times, did I not? Why didn't you obey?"

Gumanaram could find no answer and bent his head in shame.

"It was me that you were invoking and I heard," Mahaprabhuji continued. "But don't worry, you have learnt your lesson and you won't lose your corn. On the contrary, I promise you a very good harvest. However, so that this will remain for you an unforgettable lesson, I shall demand a penalty. One quarter of your crop you must donate to your small brothers, the birds. This you must promise me."

Gumanaram nodded thankfully and promised.

This story can raise all sorts of questions. Many of you may think, "What a truly curious story, just like an old fairy tale," and yet I can only assure you with all the sincerity at my disposal that it happened! Even those who were witness to such miracles had difficulty in comprehending what they had just been privy to. It's simply not within our common definition of the possible that a man may simply say, "Let there be rain," and it shall rain, or that he can know what is happening at far-off distances as if he himself were present.

But it was said right at the beginning that the Divine Soul, the perfect incarnation, has control over the elements and laws of the universe. Mahaprabhuji had command over the water element and could therefore call for rain.





The next events took place many years later but because they concern the Ruler Thakur Bhur Singh, I will include them here.

Seriously ill, the thakur lay in the hospital at Udaipur and from there wrote to Mahaprabhuji at Khatu.

"Lord, I greatly desire to see you but unfortunately I have been confined to bed for quite some time. As soon as I recover I would like to visit you in Khatu."

In answer, he received a letter from Mahaprabhuji which ended like this: "Twelve days after you receive this letter I shall be with you."

Bhur Singhji was delighted at these kind words from his Master and wondered what occasion would bring Mahaprabhuji to Udaipur. What Bhur Singhji did not know was that ten days after he had received this note, Mahaprabhuji's great soul had left the earth.

On the twelfth day Bhur Singhji was talking with some visitors in his hospital room. It was already quite late in the evening when he looked out of the window and was startled to see a horse carriage driving up with Mahaprabhuji inside. Bhur Singhji rose from his bed in excitement.

"Highly praised be Gurudeva! The almighty Master has come, just as he said he would!"

All the guests stood and greeted him respectfully as Mahaprabhuji entered the room. Mahaprabhuji inquired about the thakur 's health and wished him a speedy recovery.

Bhur Singh replied with a verse from The Ramayana : "O Lord, nowhere in the entire universe can any harm come to those who are protected by your mercy."

Then he asked, "How is that you have come here alone tonight? Until now I have always seen you travel in the company of a number of devotees."

With his familiar warm smile, he gave a reply that Thakur Bhur Singh was only to understand later.

"I am never alone, for I am One with all and all are One with me."

Mahaprabhuji then said, "Now I must leave. You have my blessing."

Bhur Singh was truly sorry that he could not stay longer and regretfully accompanied Mahaprabhuji to the horse carriage and helped him inside. Strangely enough, the coach had no driver, but the horse moved into a trot as if guided by an invisible hand. Watching it depart, Bhur Singhji saw it simply disappear after some metres, as though it just dissolved into the air.

Confused and bewildered, he looked to his friends, who had been watching the scene from the window of his room. Just as astonished as he, they answered his silent question.

"Yes, we saw it too. Do you understand . . .?"

The rest of the night Bhur Singh spent in deep reflection, pondering the meaning of Mahaprabhuji's miraculous appearance and disappearance. Early the next day a letter was handed to the thakur which reported that two days earlier Mahaprabhuji had left this world to unite once again with the Cosmic Light.

The soul of the great and humble Thakur Bhur Singhji was unable to withstand the news.

Feeling as if a heavy weight lay upon his chest, he leaned back into the pillows and prayed, "Mahaprabhuji, I want to be with you forever! God, I beg you, please receive my soul!" and with this he chanted OM and his soul left the body.

Vijaya Singh, the thakur 's son, was at his father's side in this last hour and he told me this story.

Shaken by the unforeseen death of his father, the young man had no idea how he should transport the deceased from Udaipur back to his home village. To regain his composure he decided to take a walk through the beautiful town with its hills and lakes. As he aimlessly wandered about he chanced to meet two Americans who kindly asked him why he looked so troubled. He told them the whole story, concluding with the fact that he was all alone in Udaipur and had no money to transport his father's body. Without hesitation these good-hearted tourists offered him their help, made their car available to him and supported him in every possible way.

## [Karma Yogi, Sri Mangilalji Maheshwari](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/sri-mangilalji-maheshwari)

In the Nagaur district of Rajasthan, in the village of Harsor, there lived a scholar named Sri Mangilalji, of the rich merchant family of Maheshwaris. Sri Mangilalji was very learned, being versed in the eight main languages of India: Sanskrit, Hindi, English, Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali and Punjabi. He was also a humble and wise man and his life was governed by but one passion — to see God. With this object he travelled throughout India, making pilgrimages and seeking out sadhus and swamis .

Again and again he would pose to them the yearning questions of his heart, "Have you seen God? How can I find him?"

And according to the beliefs of the persons whom he asked, he received many different answers.

He was told to fast, to recite certain mantras , make sacrifices or perform fire ceremonies and practise specific yoga techniques to ensure enlightenment. A bewildering variety of methods were recommended to him, many being in flagrant contradiction of each other, but not a single one led Sri Mangilalji to that for which he longed so passionately.

Eventually his search was so unrewarding that a great depression settled on him and he became resigned to the idea that if God were so impossible to find, then he must not exist at all. From then on he rejected the teachings of all swamis , yogis and holy scriptures. Fortunately, due to his good karma , he ultimately met some devotees of Mahaprabhuji who told him about their Guru . Their words brought life again to the longing in his heart for God.

Filled with spiritual desire, Sri Mangilalji travelled to Bari Khatu and when his eyes met the loving glance of Mahaprabhuji, his inner Self began to open and a feeling of profound contentment and joy poured through him. So it is when a true seeker of God meets with a soul who is One with the Supreme. The inner awakening takes place as naturally as the sun spreads its warmth and light.

In this moment Sri Mangilalji felt that his longing had been fulfilled and with folded hands, he requested Mahaprabhuji, "Lord, be merciful and accept me as your disciple."

The merciful Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji spoke and showered upon the devoted disciple the nectar of Divine wisdom in which the Divine power himself manifests his omnipotence and Omnipresence.

Sri Mangilalji was filled with such inner happiness that he sincerely begged to be ordained as swami .

Mahaprabhuji looked at him full of grace.

"My dear son, for you it is not necessary to dye your clothes another colour in order to seek and serve God. I have already coloured your heart with an orange hue. Do you still insist on the external vestment or is the inner Self enough?"

"O Ocean of Mercy!" Sri Mangilalji replied. "Of course it's not the swami 's robe that I desire, but the inner God-realization."

"Don't confuse the two," Mahaprabhuji said, "for they do not necessarily go together. To find your Self and realize your Oneness with God, you don't have to become a swami or leave home to go wandering the Himalayas. God is everywhere and holds out his kind hand to each who truthfully seeks him, be he yogi , swami or one who stands in worldly life."

Mahaprabhuji raised his right hand and laid it on Mangilalji's head. He went into deep samadhi and saw visions of all the holy incarnations, among them Krishna, Rama, Moses, Jesus, Buddha and Mohammed, as well as those God-realized souls such as Shankar­a­charya, Dattatraiya, Chetanya Mahaprabhu and all Omniscient and Omni­present ones. He saw all of them within Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji and Mahaprabhuji in all of them.

Mahaprabhuji then gave Mangilalji a mantra , beginning with the sacred "OM SO HAM."

He taught him a kriya technique, then dismissed him with these words.

"At a place where you will be alone and undisturbed, you shall perform your sadhana . At Shivbagh Ashram there is a meditation cave especially built for yogis to practise in. You can go there. Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto Truth and remember God."

Sri Mangilalji went and practised faithfully as his Master had told him. For the three months of the Indian winter he remained in the cave and with Gurudeva's blessing, during that time he attained the Divine state of self realization.

Here I am reminded of a wonderful Indian folk tale about a hungry fox who passed under a coconut tree. Lying on the ground was a coconut and its smell was so enticing that the fox wanted to eat it. He began to roll it around with his paws and bite at it, but the husk was too hard for him to break. The smell, on the other hand, was so sweet that he could not stop trying. He couldn’t eat the coconut, but neither could he leave it alone.

Self-realization is like that coconut. Our mind is as desirous as the fox, but the wish alone cannot bring the sweet taste of the fruit. To reach this goal, two things are absolutely necessary: the ever-strong longing and desire, and the help of a Divine Master like Sri Mahaprabhuji. To open the hard shell the aspirant requires a tool and this comes in the presence and blessing of the Master. Through his grace alone can the tough nut of ignorance be forced open.  Only then can the disciple enjoy the fruit of wisdom and God realization. He becomes One with God and stands beyond space and time, eternal, immortal and Omnipresent.

Sri Mangilalji was always in a state of happy serenity and peace of mind — he was one with his inner Self. He continued to make spiritual progress (for attaining one step does not mean that one cannot still climb higher) and within six months he had attained the highest state of Omniscience.

He attracted numerous devotees who were inspired by him, just like the lamp need not invite the gnats, for as soon as the lamp is lit, the gnats gather around by themselves. So are spiritual seekers drawn to the Enlightened, for merely to catch a glimpse of such a one brings peace to their hearts.

Sri Mangilalji's mind was as silent and clear as a deep well and he radiated perfect peace. He knew the minds and hearts of those who came to him and he understood the language of the animals and birds. The spirit of his communion with Mahaprabhuji was so deep that he could anticipate all Gurudeva's wishes. To explain this sudden and great transformation to his friends, Sri Mangilalji sang a bhajan :



SATAGURU SACCA MILIA JAB SE HI

I found the true Guru and he has removed my doubts, Before I met him I heard many voices saying, "Pilgrimages! Fasts! Fire ceremonies!" But Gurudeva has shown me the essence of all, He opened my inner door And showed me God dwelling in my heart, The flame dissolved in the flame.

The flower is in the fragrance And the fragrance is in the flower, He pervades the heart.

When all my doubts were gone, all karma was banished, The internal and eternal are One, Only the external is many, Mangilal declares that Satguru showed me the ineffable Purusha.

This bhajan of accomplished poetry in Hindi, grasped the true believers and many could then imagine the spiritual heights to which Sri Mangilalji had risen.

Unfortunately in this world there exists much negative energy and even the highest and most gentle of souls cannot escape its attack. Wherever Sri Mangilalji went, people would gather about him to request satsang or to seek his advice. The number of his devotees grew, but at the same time, as happens through man's ignorance, there was an increasing group who were jealous and envious of his success.

It is true that they could do him no real harm, but they acted as despicably as they could, offering their humblest obeisance to his face but slandering him behind his back. Others bribed a group of crude and illiterate sadhus to go to Mangilalji as seekers and try to expose him with challenging questions.

As it happened, a group of these sadhus once approached Sri Mangilalji during a satsang and immediately began to fire all sorts of belligerent questions at him. Eagerly they tried their best to antagonise and discredit him.

Sri Mangilalji only patiently waited until they had run out of steam.

"Brothers, be welcome!" he said with kindness. "Sit down here with me and take something to eat and drink."

Disarmed by this peaceful reception, the sadhus sat down and Mangilalji continued.

"You are religious men and as such ought to set an example for the world by greeting all living beings with love and kindness. If we, as God's servants, don't show humility and goodness, then what will ordinary people do?"

His quiet and peaceful manner made such an impression on the sadhus that their hearts melted and they were greatly ashamed of their previous evil intentions.

"Great Mangilalji, please forgive us! We came in ignorance thinking you were just an imposter, but in just these few minutes you have taught us so much. We wish to extend our thanks to you and your parents who gave birth to such a wise son. We also offer our humble respects to your Divine Master who has imparted to you such wisdom and patience. Dear sir, tell us what we now ought to do!"

In answer, Sri Mangilalji sang a bhajan :

SADHO BHAI ABA KYU KARO TUM MORO

Spiritual brothers, you must not procrastinate! Turn your concentration to meditation,

The twenty-five workmen [1] demolish the barriers of doubts And construct a roadway there, The day is nearly done, so don't lose time! Discipline is your coach, concentration your horse, It is a long journey, urge your horse on! Many rivers must be crossed along the way But do not hesitate or be troubled in your mind, Go along!

Mangilal says: This is the only way you will reach that place, Any other course will bring you great suffering, Don't wait! Wake up and work for this!

All were deeply stirred by this spontaneous song.

Many of Mahaprabhuji's disciples were excellent poets and musicians. Religious songs are still very much used as a means of expression in India and an artist in this field is highly appreciated.

That envious group of men who had sent the sadhus to expose Mangilalji, watched all this from a short distance and seeing the turn of events became enraged.

"There is something strange about this!" they thought. "This swami has either hypnotised them or brandished magic formulas!"

Sri Mangilalji, aware of their thoughts, began to sing another song, this one intended for their ears:



KYU BHARAM KARE SANSARIJI

I don't need hypnotic powers, O worldly men, Why do you persist in doubt? I only spoke true words, I only gave them the epitome of truth, Who will understand this? Do I not know that hypnosis and magic are worthless? How should I lie in wait to ensnare them? I depend on nothing but the name of God, Which I give to real devotees who come to me, I teach Sat Sanatan Dharma.

I am telling you about liberation, These words are swallowed by the Hansa, Through true knowledge the mind becomes pure, His concentration is aimed only towards God, The goose becomes a swan flying to heaven, The sound of Mahavakyas makes the worried happy And frees the suffering from his pains.

I spoke to you with great softness, With Bhakti and love of the truth, Sri Mangilal says: A herald of the truth am I.

Then the jealous ones realized that they had been unjust and felt ashamed of their wretched attempts to humble this wise and holy man.

There are endless variations on the theme of ignorance. Undoubtedly it is true that we all want to find happiness but often we come up with the most peculiar and misguided ways imaginable to search for it.

Once some ascetics came to Mangilalji and were stating their method for attaining happiness.

"Except for cow's milk we take no food. We sleep with our heads down, suspended from a bar or tree branch. We have no attachment to family and are always in a state of bliss."

These ascetics gave no impression of being blissful so Mangilalji told them, "My brothers, without the guidance of a realized Master you will remain entangled in this ignorance. What you are doing is absurd! Liberation, true bliss, can only be achieved through the realization of the Divine."

Still the ascetics held to the validity of their view and a discussion took place which went back and forth.

Finally, Mangilalji sang them a bhajan :

YON MUNDA MUNDHAVO SADHO TUM KARATE

It's not necessary to leave home, Renounce your family and wear certain kinds of clothes, It means nothing to torture the body by deprivation or peculiar postures.

If you persist and go to extremes, You may even die And then you have wasted the precious chance to learn in this lifetime.

There is no attainment of peace Without Self knowledge, And there is no Knowledge without the help of the Satguru.

After all their resistance, Sri Mangilalji gradually won the hearts of the ascetic sadhus and they became close friends. Abandoning their futile methods, they instead followed the initiation of Mangilalji and began to meditate.

Because of a few unfortunate examples, some people believe that yogis and swamis smoke hashish and take drugs. In reality, the ideals of yoga philosophy are absolutely contrary to this. Drugs are destructive of both body and mind and as such are inconsistent with the efforts undertaken by swamis and yogis to clean, purify and unfold consciousness. Drugs also create addiction, whereas the aim of yoga is freedom — liberation.

Once a group of misguided ones were talking with Sri Mangilalji and tried to convince him that he should meditate under the influence of these substances. They assured him that it would be a wonderful experience and that he would gain all kind of new insights.

Mangilalji only replied with a bhajan :

NAHSA KAR NAM KA PYARE

O brothers, became intoxicated with the Lord's name, Why smoke marijuana and hashish, cocaine and opium And weaken the body? Why do you undergo so much suffering? You will free yourself from this addiction with difficulty.

Intoxication of love is forever blissful, It remains uniform always.

Concentrate your mind on God, This will purify you from bad karmas .

I found my Gurudev, Mahaprabhu Deep Hari, Who taught me this art of getting intoxicated, Mangilal says: He has awakened Divine love in my heart.

In replay to a man who requested from Sri Mangilalji a loan of a thousand rupees , he also answered spontaneously with a bhajan :

HAZAR CHA HI JE TO BAZAR MILE MOKSH CHA HI JE TO GURU DVAR MILE

To earn money, go to the bazaar, But if you long for liberation then you should knock at the door of the Guru.

Everyone gets what he deserves, Distinction between the ephemeral and the eternal, You will gain through Satsang, A vision of the Highest Truth, only by the grace of the Guru, The soul bursts into bloom when it reaches the Divine home, Through Hari it realizes Brahman, God Realization fills it with love.

The study of the Vedas only imparts limited knowledge But meeting with a Yogi destroys the ephemeral, With the beginning you reach middle and end, Through a Saint you find the essence of life, The essence of life leads you to Divine Truth.

By finding Gurudeva you find the key, Finding the key you will find the lock, Finding the lock you will find the treasure, Finding the treasure you will find the diamond, Finding the diamond you will find the light, Finding the light you will find the flame, Finding the flame you will obtain power Obtaining power you will obtain fearlessness, Obtaining fearlessness you will reach your aim, Reaching your aim you will experience the indescribable, Experiencing the indescribable the brightness will appear to you, With the appearing of the brightness your eyes will be opened, By opening your eyes you will find the heart, Finding the heart you will attain gentleness, Attaining gentleness you will gain Ananda, Gaining Ananda the Lotus will open, By opening the Lotus there will open Mana and Buddhi, By opening Mana and Buddhi you will gain knowledge, Gaining knowledge you will realize the limitless, Realizing the limitless you will recognize the principle, Recognizing the principle, knower and knowledge will unite, When knower and knowledge are united then you are in meditation, Being in meditation great knowledge will be revealed to you, Realizing great knowledge, science will be revealed to you, Realizing science you will recognize the essence, Recognizing the essence you will attain clarity, Attaining clarity you will win love, Winning love you will experience the Name, Experiencing the Name you will recognize the form, Recognizing the form you will recognize the formless, Recognizing the formless you will recognize the manifestation, Recognizing the manifestation you will recognize the source, Recognizing the source you will attain Ananda, Attaining Ananda you will attain Paramananda, Attaining Paramananda you will receive Prasad, Receiving Prasad you will reach the endlessness.

If you find God's devotee you will free yourself from all arguments, By freeing yourself from all arguments you will find the essence, Finding the essence the Hansa will awaken in you, By awakening the Hansa you will find the pearls, Finding the pearls you will attain liberation, Attaining liberation you will come to the end, Coming to the end you will gain Ananda, Gaining Ananda you will find the moon, Gaining the moon you will find the light, Finding the light you will find the flame, Finding the flame you will find the pearl-shell, Finding the pearl-shell you will find the ruby, Finding the ruby you will find Brahman, Finding Brahman you will gain Ananda, Gaining Ananda you will widen your vision, By widening your vision, creation will be revealed to you, By recognizing creation a rain of bliss will flow over you, By the flow of bliss you will find the eight (i.e. the Chakras), Finding the eight you will gain Divine Consciousness, Gaining Divine Consciousness you will find Deep, Finding Deep you will get liberation.

Mangilal says: By meeting the liberator you will find the right technique, Finding the right technique you will find all, And the seeker will unite with Brahman.

Once Sri Mangilalji was asked why bhakti was so difficult to achieve and he answered in a poem that bhakti was possible only for one who has gained control over the mind and thrown off the ego. This is very difficult, as sensual objects and sensual pleasures are everywhere to distract the mind and lead it astray. But by the grace of the merciful Sri Maha­prabhuji, nothing stands in the way of obtaining true bhakti .

A great number of wonderful bhajans have been transmitted by Sri Mangilalji. Their themes are self realization, God-realization and yoga and they praise the grace and mercy of Gurudeva Sri Mahaprabhuji. They have been collected in the book Sri Mangilal Bhajan Mala , which as yet has been published only in Hindi.

Now I shall tell about the end of Sri Mangilalji's life. He announced the hour of his departure one year in advance. A month before his samadhi he invited Mahaprabhuji to his village, Harsor, where they celebrated joyful satsangs together with many other happy devotees. One week before he left, the devotees gathered to sing bhajans and kirtan s without interruption day and night.

The day on which he departed from this world, Sri Mangilalji practised his meditation and morning prayers as usual, then with folded hands took leave from all his family, friends and devotees. He only wished them a temporary farewell as he knew they would meet in the spiritual world of Gurudeva.

Then, bowing before Mahaprabhuji, he spoke.

"Mahaprabhuji, by Thy grace all my wishes have been fulfilled, but still one remains. You are the Light of the universe, the Almighty, merciful Master, the Ocean of Grace and liberator from all harm. In this dark age you have appeared to help and rescue us, but people are deluded by maya and do not recognise you. Because of this they are deprived of the blessing your existence brings to them, their suffering is so great! Lord, your name is Omnipotent and contains unlimited bliss, peace, glory and power. Your name Itself is the holy bija-mantra [2] .

"My wish is this: To be reborn in this world so that I may bring people the gift of your holy name. Learning to worship your name they can achieve blissful happiness, in this world and the world beyond. In their ignorance many of your disciples see worldly pleasures as the highest goal in life and because of this they will be reborn in the West. Some already live there and others still will follow. If you grant me this wish, then I will spread your light to the whole world! This is the grace which I request of you."

"May it be as you wish," Mahaprabhuji replied, full of love. "Your soul has become one with the Supreme. Whoever unites with God becomes Shiva, the Highest Self. Your wish will be fulfilled in your next life and I will be with you then also."

After Mahaprabhuji had granted this promise, Sri Mangilalji bowed his head at Gurudeva's feet and Mahaprabhuji laid his hands upon Sri Mangilalji's head in blessing. Sri Mangilalji sang OM, whereupon the breath of life left his mortal frame through Brahma-Randhra and he became one with the Divine.

This occurred at ten o'clock in the morning and at exactly that time in Bola Guda (more than 200 kilometres away), Ram Singhji was standing in front of the ashram when he was surprised to suddenly see Sri Mangilalji beside him.

"How is it that you are here?" he asked, astonished. "I was led to believe that you would depart from this world today, at your home in Harsor. In fact, Sri Swami Shankar Puriji has gone there to be with you and I also wanted to go but my duty has kept me here."

"It doesn't matter," Sri Mangilalji replied with a serene smile. "In this world of maya , truth and untruth often flow together. Come, let us go into our ashram ."

Sri Mangilalji pointed at the meditation cave.

"In this place I attained Self-realization and here my beloved Gurudeva also sat. This place is very dear to my heart and I request that when I leave this world a monument be placed here in my memory."

They talked on but then Ram Singhji excused himself.

"Please forgive me, but I must settle something important. I'll be back in a few minutes and then we can talk some more."

He began to walk away and after some metres turned to look back at Mangilalji but saw his form dissolve into light. Ram Singhji thought he had hallucinated this vision and for some time even looked around for Sri Mangilalji but could find no trace of him.

A day later Ram Singhji received a telegram in which he was informed of Sri Mangilalji's departure from the world at ten o'clock the previous day. He then realized that he had been witness to a miracle that Sri Mangilalji had accomplished through his spiritual power and for this Ram Singhji felt richly blessed.

Sri Mangilalji's life is a golden example for all those who live as householders with family and business responsibilities, that they too can attain the highest spiritual heights, generally thought possible only for renunciates.

## [Mahamandaleshwar Sri Swami Lalananda Puri](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/mahamandaleshwar-sri-swami-lalananda-puri)

In Pava in the Nagaur district of Rajasthan there lived a spiritual and religious man named Sri Sunda Puriji from the Goswami family. Sri Sunda Puriji's son, named Lalananda, was the nephew of Mahaprabhuji. Even when very young he felt attracted to God and he used to meditate or seek satsangs to attend.

Perhaps it should be explained what a satsang was like in the days before people became as busy and preoccupied as they are today.

" Sat " means truth and " sang " means company. Satsang is the gathering of spiritual devotees to speak about truth, about God.

Mostly, satsang was celebrated in devotion to a personified God. Spiritual devotees would meet together in a temple, or ashram or private home and sing spiritual songs and bhajans . The leader of the satsang was either a swami , priest, or lay person who could interpret the songs or bhajans , line by line, revealing the essence of the poetic language and clearly explaining the meaning. Often the satsang went on all night and at sunrise there would be prayer and the distribution of prasad .

Unfortunately these joyful, all-night satsangs are now rare. In the towns or cities the people generally gather for about an hour, listen to records instead of singing, drink tea and then go home.

In former times, Indian village women would celebrate a wedding by singing for three or four long evenings without ever repeating a song. They may have been illiterate but they knew a great many things by heart. Today the town girls know nothing but a few pop songs. All over the world so much tradition is being lost and people know more about film stars than they do about the Saints and philosophers of their own country.

But when Lalananda was a boy there were neither movies nor radio and the satsangs he so happily attended lasted all night. There he would sit through the long hours, awake and alert the whole time, listening and absorbing all the wisdom.

A very good satsang was once given by the mahant [1] Dayal Puriji from Kharadiya, a monk of great holiness. It so happened that as Dayal Puriji was singing, the boy Lalanandji, who had been listening intently, slipped into samadhi [2] and he stayed in this state of consciousness during the whole celebration.

Dayal Puriji was fascinated.

"Never have I experienced such a deep and continuous state of samadhi , nor have I ever seen it before. What a boy! He must have been a great Saint in a previous life."

The mahant decided to adopt Lalanandji and to train the boy to be his successor, as he felt sure that Lalanandji would eventually achieve the honoured office of mahaman­dalesh­war [3] . Mahant Dayal Puriji explained his plans to Lalanandji's parents and asked their permission to take him into the monastery.

The parents were religious and feeling extremely honoured, said, "Sir, if it is your wish you may take our child with you. We are all children of God, all brothers under the one father. May he learn well and accomplish all that you have planned for him."

So Mahant Dayal Puriji took Lalananda with him to the matha [4] of Kharadiya, where he educated the boy and looked after him with great love. He felt himself fortunate to have the pure, calm and contented child there. The child's happiness was infectious and the older man would feel its warmth whenever he looked at him.

When Lalananda grew up he succeeded Dayal Puriji as head of the matha and, as the elder mahant had predicted, he attained the respected office of mahamandaleshwar .

Lalanandji conscientiously carried out his daily duties but found that they did not completely satisfy him, he lacked inner contentment. His heart was constantly occupied with the need to find a Guru , a Self-realized Master. Eventually he went to visit Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji. Lalananda went many times to Mahaprabhuji’s ashram , where Gurudeva's words began to fill that empty place in his heart.

One day he put his trust completely in Mahaprabhuji's guidance.

"Lord, I am filled with a great longing to have your Divine Light illuminate me. Please inspire my heart."

"It shall be so," Mahaprabhuji replied. "You will be initiated on the occasion of Gurupurnima. On that day you will realize your True Self."

On Gurupurnima, the day of the full moon at the end of June or the beginning of July (according to the Western calendar), Lalanandji arrived at the ashram at daybreak and reverently greeted Mahaprabhuji with a prayer:



SRI DEEP DINA DAYAL PRABHUJI VANDANA

O Divine Protector, Mahaprabhu Deep, this is my prayer to you! Lead me across the ocean of Maya and liberate me From the bonds of the world.

King Janaka, Shukra, Vashista and many other Saints realized you.

The four Vedas, the eighteen Puranas and all other holy scriptures Praise the grace of the Guru.

Omniscient One, you are unchangeable love, You are the origin, you are present in the whole universe, You are in all beings, the sun, moon and stars, You lead your devotees to true Dharma, You are the manifested Brahman, the Lord of my heart, Lalananda says, I am your devotee, Blessed is the ground beneath your feet.

Lalanandji sang another bhajan :

HO GURU SUKHA DHAMA SWAMI

My Guru and Master, source of bliss, Origin of the world, Eternal joy, radiating Divine blessing I take my shelter in you, You are the liberator, it is you alone who acts, At one time you are both Shiva and the creator of the universe, The sustainer of all things and the destroyer of all that is offensive, You are God.

Even the Vedas are unable to describe you in words, To you, the Preserver, Protector and Rescuer of the whole world I dedicate my body, mind and property, Lalananda asks you, O Mahaprabhuji, Divine Light, let me be near you!

Mahaprabhuji smiled on him favourably and in blessing placed his hand on Lalanandji's head. The Divine power of Gurudeva filled Lalanandji's heart and he knew enlightenment. He became one with all and this state never left him again. Day and night Lalanandji burned with the pure flame of Divine joy in Gurudeva's presence. He had reached the state of vairagya — total consciousness of God.

This was the sign of Guru kripa , the grace of the Guru . Through a single glance of a Divine Master like Mahaprabhuji the disciple attains Self-realization, but there is also need of a pure and completely surrendered disciple, who takes the Guru's blessing deep into his heart.

Could an ordinary person begin to understand what his being had become? Lalananda sang this song:

KYA TUM JANO HAL HAMARA

You do not know my state of mind — The Satguru's arrow pierced me, I flew with it to eternity, He met me and my tears ran, Each fibre in me vibrates, as I am filled With the Light of Reality, This sweet vexation of the heart is known only to the Saints, I fainted, fell to the ground and my heart burst open.

Neither doctor nor judge knows this pain, Only those with similar wounds can share it, I found the perfect Master, Lord Mahaprabhu Deep, He reshaped the world of my consciousness, The arrow of his word, that wound made my mind Lofty and free.

Lalananda says, all his worries have flown away, His life shines as clear as the sunrise.

Lalanandji has also left us a poem about the grace of his Master's mercy.

SANTO ATMA DHAN KO PAYA

I found the treasure of the Atma, My Master granted me his grace and imparted the truth. I was required neither to shave my head nor grow my hair long, Nor pierce my ears nor smear my body with ash, No magic, no Tantra, no pilgrimage was required, Nor had I to bathe in the Ganges, or dig a cave, I did not practise Asanas or Pranayama Nor did I fast or worship any statue.

To my Guru I offer eternal thanks, To him who freed me from worldly things, Through him I realized the only Reality.

Sri Lalanandji wrote hundreds of bhajans and poems that praised Mahaprabhuji's glory.

He also wrote about the soul, the Divine Self, truth, reality, religion and yoga. His poetry is collected in a book titled Sri Lalananda Bhajan Bodh Prakash . He wrote very elegant Hindi and Sanskrit as well. His satsangs were famous and he was called a Lakhsharthi, a wise man who has realized his goal and thus can lead others as well.

At the end of his life he united with the Supreme through his yogic power and left the world in samadhi .





[1] mahant = spiritual head of a monastery, the Christian equivalent is an abbot who is the superior of an abbey of monks

[2] There are several states of samadhi , some of which can be reached in meditation spontaneously. But these are only steps on the spiritual path and don't mean self realization. Only the highest state, the nirvikalpa samadhi , leads to turiya (highest consciousness), moksha (liberation) and God-realization. That highest state of samadhi can only be attained through the guidance and blessing of the Guru .

[3] mahamandaleshwar = head of an order, of monasteries

[4] matha = monastery

## [Sri Devpuriji's Mahasamadhi](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/1570-sri-devpurijis-mahasamadhi)

Before Yogiraj Sri Devpuriji left this world he told his disciples, "Tomorrow morning I shall leave this body."

They were unable to believe him, they saw him, healthy and strong, standing before them.

"Impossible!" they thought to themselves. "How could his life end tomorrow when today he stands before us like this?"

With perplexed expressions they looked at him.

"That is all!" he said.

The next morning, as usual, Sri Devpuriji washed himself and changed his clothes and at a quarter past five he sat in lotus posture and chanted OM five times. With the last sound of OM, his Divine Self left the body. His disciples noticed his motionless body was lifeless and greatly lamented that his announcement had been true. They felt a deep remorse for not having believed him.

Thousands of people gathered for the traditional funeral ceremony to pay their last respects. The date of this event would have been 1941 or 1942.

Even today many faithful still travel great distances to Sri Devpuriji's ashram to pray for the solution of their problems and the fulfilment of their desires.

The day on which Sri Devpuriji had declared his departure from this world, Mahaprabhuji was staying with his disciples in Bari Khatu in the palace of Thakur Revat Singh. The Omniscient Mahaprabhuji was aware of his Master's intention and held an all-night satsang .

Swami Lalanandji was singing his morning raga in a clear and melodious tone when Mahaprabhuji exclaimed, "Stop! It's now a quarter past five. The gracious Lord of Kailash, Gurudev Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji, has just left this world to unite again with Brahman!"

Mahaprabhuji then instructed Thakur Revat Singh to distribute food to the cows, the birds and the whole village and the Maharaja hurried to do so. Later, after the message of Sri Devpuriji's mahasamadhi arrived at the palace, Mahaprabhuji travelled with Thakur Revat Singh and other devotees to Kailash.

The villagers, farmers and merchants of the area welcomed them and, despite everyone's general mourning, they received the warmest hospitality. All offered prayers to Sri Devpuriji's shrine and with his spiritual power, Maha­prabhuji soothed the hearts of those sad and faithful ones who greatly suffered the loss of their Divine Master because they had not listened to his last words on this earth.

People still speak of the soothing comfort that was experienced by Mahapra­bhuji's presence.

## [Yoga Nidra - The Sleep of Yogis](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/1560-yoga-nidra-the-sleep-of-yogis)

During his stay in Pushkar, Mahaprabhuji was visited by some ascetic yogis who entertained peculiar ideas about the spiritual path. It was part of their belief to force the body to extremes such as eating very little, depriving themselves of sleep and exposing their almost naked bodies to the stinging rays of the sun and nightly frosts. In short, they performed very extreme practices.

The body is the home of the soul and therefore we should protect it and keep it healthy, not torture it. Of course the body should be under our control and not we under its, but mortification will not prove advantageous.

When the ascetics arrived at the ashram at midday, they saw Mahaprabhuji covered with a shawl resting.

"This swami leads a very comfortable life," they whispered. "He probably spends a lot of time eating and sleeping."

Mahaprabhuji sat up, somewhat to their surprise and greeted them respectfully.

"To welcome you to this ashram , I will sing you a bhajan . Just listen. This song is about yoga nidra , the "sleep of the yogi ."



YOGI JANO KI YOGA-NINDRA

Rare is he who knows Yoga Nidra, That sleep which is conscious, The sun rises in the night! His eyes are closed But they are connected with the all-seeing inner consciousness, His bed is prepared in Shunya, in nothingness, Completely detached from the body, The nature of that place is white and void.

The flower that is upside down Opens its blossom in front of him, These words come out of that medium, The hovering bond of consciousness is tied with Turiya, In the void numerous suns rise And the unrealizable is realized, The power of Divine nature awakens, The upside-down blossom awakens the power and grows into Super-Consciousness.

Consciousness unites with Super-Consciousness The Yogi attains selfhood And listens to the noiseless sound of the DivineName, Immediately his consciousness is united with the Supreme, He gains knowledge of the Tattvas, the elements, Because his consciousness has returned to its heavenly home.

There is only void-consciousness, no other vision, Nothing else is visible, Before he reached this state, his words lacked certainty, He was standing at the border shouting questions About what was beyond, Now he is Purusha, complete, And his words express that which is beyond expression.

Omniscient Shiva revealed the science of Yoga, Sri Krishna explained it in the Gita, Many Saints and Yogis have sung its ancient glory But few indeed have realized it.

Alakh Puriji, the true Sannyasi, has realized the complete, Sri Devpuriji, Master of the Yogis, Showed me that formless world, Only few know about Yoga Nidra, They can understand what the Guru is.

Mahaprabhu Deep says that they are the true heroes who Awaken the Eternal Consciousness within their consciousness.

During the bhajan the ascetics sat silent and alert, so as not to miss one word. They begged Mahaprabhuji's pardon for their ignorant interpretation.

"Fooled by outward appearance we took you for an ordinary man taking his ease. Today for the first time we have heard of this technique of yoga nidra . Your beautiful words have pierced our hearts like arrows and awakened the wish for personal experience of this knowledge coming from God. Great Master, we beg of you, teach us this extraordinary sleep of the yogis !"

In his grace, Mahaprabhuji consented and he taught them the technique of attaining that state of conscious sleep. Then, raising his hand over them, he enabled them to enter into it.

On returning to normal consciousness he told them, "I have made you a gift of this experience so that you know what you will be searching for. Yoga nidra is a state of consciousness in which you are connected with that Divine energy pervading the whole Cosmos. This energy is beyond space and time and during this state of consciousness you can see past, present and future. You know your past lives and what will manifest in the future. Through yoga nidra you can work through karmas, as this clarity penetrates levels of the unconscious and subconscious. Yoga nidra is a great technique that is not so easily Mastered, as there is always the danger of falling into normal sleep."

This technique can only be taught by a Master who has gained control over it himself. In the beginning, yoga nidra is used just as a physical and mental relaxation technique, but this is not the true sleep of a yogi , which penetrates into much deeper levels of consciousness. Yoga nidra should not be confused with techniques of auto-suggestion, or "autogenous training," through which spiritual transformation or effect cannot be achieved.

Sri Devpuriji developed yoga nidra and passed it on to Mahaprabhuji. This is supported by reports that it was taught to his disciples since 1880. On his journeys to the Himalayas, Sri Devpuriji met, among others, Swami Shivananda of Rishikesh and Swami Muktananda, who is well known in Europe and conveyed the technique of yoga nidra to several yogis and swamis . Thus yoga nidra gradually spread throughout India and finally to Europe and America.

## [Thakur Revat Singh](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/thakur-revat-singh)

In the Nagaur district of Rajasthan in the village of Bari Khatu, there lived the ruling family known as Chopavat Rathor. This family ruled over that village and others in the area, being subject itself only to the maharaja of Jodhpur.

The lords of this royal house were known for their strictness and cruelty. If a villager was summoned to the palace, it was cause for great fear and not without reason. One usual practice was to force a person accused of crime to carry an enormously heavy stone upon his head while being interrogated. This certainly was a deterrent to crime, but it only worked because it created such fear. Intimidation and torture however, are never desirable methods to maintain law and order.

This royal family led an extravagant life. Each day many goats and chickens were slaughtered and much alcohol consumed. The evenings in the palace were spent in orgies of feasting and drinking. However, when Sri Revat Singh succeeded his father as Ruler, he turned out to be an exception. A kind and gentle person, he had higher interests than those of eating, drinking and celebrating. It was during his rule, that the fame of Sri Devpuriji and Mahaprabhuji had spread far and wide.

One day Sri Revat Singh thought to himself, "Until now I haven’t paid attention to the fact that there are two holy souls living in my land. For the benefit of my soul, I think I shall go to them to receive their blessing."

Acting on this sudden impulse, he set off with his entourage for Sri Deva Dungary sannyas Ashram, where Mahaprabhuji lived.

When the Ruler and his followers caught sight of Mahaprabhuji, joy was awakened in their hearts, for the mere sight of Mahaprabhuji was enough to fill people with love and peace. Mahaprabhuji pleasantly welcomed them and inquired after the health and welfare of the lord and his family.

"Raja, your duties as Ruler take up much time," he finally stated. "So tell me, why have you troubled yourself to come here?"

"Lord, I have come to you to learn the true purpose of my life," Sri Revat Singh answered humbly with a bow.

To this Mahaprabhuji replied, "I am filled with the holy vibration of my Gurudeva. Kings, beggars, the rich and poor are all alike for me," and he sang this bhajan in his splendid voice:



DIVANA SATAGURU NAM KA MASTANA HELI

Filled with Gurudeva's name I have no desire, I am blissfully happy, peaceful like the clear, cloudless sky, Unchangeable, with the tenacity of the earth, His word is nectar for me, His existence is a refreshing spring.

He does not discriminate between high and low, Earth and diamond hold the same value before God, In him there is no desire, not even to become King of Heaven.

There is no fear of physical grief or pain, Carefree he is, without fear, It matters not if he faces king, minister or beggar, Hunger and thirst have no power over him, Immovable like a rock he remains in life and death.

Not a Siddha [1] nor a Peer [2] is the Benefactor, Swami Deep says: The Satguru is Avadhuta and Avaliya [3] , He is the greatest among all heroes. Sri Revat Singhji bowed to Mahaprabhuji.

"Our country is greatly blessed that a great Saint like yourelf lives here. Lord, I want my life to be good and worthy. With this one desire I turn to you: I have come in the great hope and belief that your mercy liberates those who seek shelter in you. Therefore I ask you to accept me as your disciple. I extend an invitation to you to live in my palace. Please come and purify my house with your holy presence."

Mahaprabhuji looked at him sternly.

"I would enter your palace right now if it would truly become pure due to my presence, but if as soon as I leave you return to old habits, then what sense would there be of my visit? My coming will only be useful when you invite me to enter your heart, then together we will purify your residence and cease all sinful practices there."

Upset, the thakur replied, "I vow that if you do me the great honour of entering my home, from that moment on nothing shall be done there without your consent."

"First, the slaughtering of animals and drinking of alcohol must cease," answered Mahaprabhuji.

The maharaja immediately agreed.

"It shall be just as you command."

Mahaprabhuji was now convinced of the sincerity of Thakur Revat Singh.

"Raja, you are honest and your thoughts are pure. I will come to your home at the time of the next full moon. You will make arrangements for satsang at your palace on that day, where all devotees shall be welcomed, no matter who or what they are."

On hearing these words, Sri Revat Singhji felt an immense bliss in his heart like, never before. Deeply moved, he bowed to Gurudeva and thanked him. Then he and his entourage left the ashram and returned to the palace.

The invitation to the forthcoming satsang was announced everywhere and this created great excitement among the villagers because it was so unusual for Mahaprabhuji to leave his ashram and enter another person's home.

"A thirsty one must go to the water, not the other way around," he used to say.

However, on this occasion he waived his rule, to fulfil the sincere wish of a devotee. The villagers were doubly surprised, not only because Mahaprabhuji was coming to them, but also because of the miraculous change in heart of their Ruler.

Preparations for the great event began. Immediately the thakur forbid any further  killing of animals and consumption of alcohol. He increased the joy of his subjects when he abolished the ordeal of the stone at the judicial trials. The whole palace was then cleaned and all walls freshly painted and decorated. All villagers and farmers under his rule were invited to attend the satsang , as well as friends, lords, dignitaries and noblemen from other areas.

According to Hindu calendar, the satsang was held on the day of Chaitra Sudhi Purnima, at the end of April when the weather is still warm after spring harvest and the farmers enjoy a break in their year’s schedule. People gathered in crowds at the palace. Men in their yellow, orange, pink and red turbans and the women in their brilliant saris all colours of the rainbow, many embroidered with gold or silver thread that flashed in the sun. The noblemen and dignitaries wore splendid uniforms.

A carriage had been beautifully decorated with flowers, tinsel and rich fabric for Mahaprabhuji. The sound of bhajans and music filled the air and the atmosphere of Bari Khatu was truly heavenly. There had never been such a celebration before and everyone took part with no thought of caste or religion.

Everyone — farmers, lords, noblemen and villagers — gathered at the ashram to fetch Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji. Humbly they greeted and garland him with mala s made of flowers [4] . In his honour they chanted bhajans , kirtans and mantras and soon the whole sky was filled with a powerful sound — it seemed as though even the angels were singing. Everyone surrounded Mahaprabhuji with happy faces and he sat among them like the full moon surrounded by sparkling stars.

Eventually the crowd parted to make way for Mahaprabhuji's vehicle and all shouted, " Maha Prabhu Deep Ki Jay – Victory to you, Mahaprabhu Deep!" " Sat Sanatan Dharma Ki Jay – Victory to the true religion!"

Slowly the carriage was carried to Khatu, accompanied by praying and singing devotees. They sang a bhajan of Swami Shivananda:



SRI DHARMA SANATAN PALAN KARAN GURU NARAYAN

To preserve the true belief and teach us our correct duty He has given me knowledge of pure consciousness, All my ignorance and blind beliefs have disappeared, He showed me the reality of the soul And I realized that this world is a dream, The chains of Karma are cut — I am the pure Self!

He led me across the ocean of Maya And Liberated me from all earthly troubles. The Sanatan of human life is to surrender to Gurudev and Ishvara, Sri Mahaprabhuji is the perfect Divine Master!

Swami Shivananda says: My deepest reverence to Gurudev, His name bestows eternal happiness, It was my great luck to meet him, he united me with the highest Self.



In the village, Mahaprabhuji was seated on a dais and at his side sat Sri Revat Singhji, his wife Srimati Chundawati and all the members of their family. A ceremonial fire was lit and they received mantra from Mahaprabhuji. As part of this ceremony it is customary to make offerings to the Guru and Sri Revat Singhji bowed low to Mahaprabhuji and offered all his land and possessions.

"Nothing belongs to me! Everything is yours!" he cried. "I merely give what already belongs to you!"

"Yes, Raja," Mahaprabhuji replied with a smile, "your land and possessions are the property of Gurudeva and you are only the administrator. But what should a swami like me do with all this wealth and worldly power? Continue to rule your land, this is your work and duty, but never forget that you are God's servant and with His blessing you will rule with love, kindness and humility. Open your heart to the pains and sorrows of your subjects and listen to the aggrieved. Serve selflessly for the benefit of all! Don't cheat the people, nor burden them with unjust taxes. See that they lack nothing and preserve justice in your land."

It was truly an auspicious occasion when Sri Revat Singhji received mantra from Mahaprabhuji and the faithful scattered colourful flowers and shouted again and again, " Sri Maha Prabhuji, Ki Jay! "

The satsang continued for three days and three nights and all spent this time singing and praying. On request, many received mantra diksha [5] from Mahaprabhuji and one of them, Seth Bankat Lal Bajaj, dedicated the following prayer to him:



OM PRABHUJI DEVO SWAMI ANTAR YAMI

OM Prabhu Deep, God of our hearts! Paramatma, Omnipresent Divine Existence, You are wisdom, liberator of illusion, Highest manifestation, Prabhu! Prabhu — Truth, Knowledge and Origin — You lead us from conflict to unity, Tattva-Darshi Mahatma [6] , The ignorant don't know the meaning of Satsang, Prabhu! Prabhu, standing beyond everything, free from all, Liberator of everyone! Immortal, Omnipresent, formless Mahatma, Prabhu! Prabhu, gracious messenger of wisdom, Eternal Paramatma, protector and preserver Beyond all earthly perception, Divine Atma! The honest one lives in Truth And follows the teachings of the Saints, The ignorant escape from the light Pursued by guilty feelings of their deeds.

Prabhu Deep, you hide in every heart, You light all three worlds, Bankat Lala begs you, liberate us from ignorance!

This prayer inspired all those present to praise and worship Mahaprabhuji.

Saints, wise men, devas and gandharvas feel deep veneration for the land where Sri Narayana has appeared. Each grain of sand of this part of the country is holy. Dear readers, how I also love the land where Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji  incarnated!

Here is another ode written by Seth Bankat Lal Bajaj in honour of Mahapra­bhuji.



PYARO DHANO LAGE MANE DES MARUDHAR

How I love the country Marudhar Where the Divine Satguru incarnated! Blessed are his Divine Mother and Father, His brothers and sister and relatives! Blessed are the country and the village, Their glory is greater than the sky, Each house is full of fortune.

Gods and Saints, Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, Hari and Shiva, Countless Rishis, Munis and Incarnations Praise Hindusthan as the highest place! Satguru Swami Deep Narayan from Khatu, Bankat Lal says, my reverence and devotion To his Holy presence!



In those days, all who came to Khatu received a blessing. Happy are those who are graced to meet a Satguru and his devout companions.

For three days more, Mahaprabhuji stayed in the residence of the maharaja and then returned to his ashram . All who had taken part in the satsang accompanied him and the bliss they felt due to the presence of Gurudeva was so great that they did not want to part from him.

"My dear brothers and sisters," he finally said to them with a loving heart, "you should return home now to your daily duties. I am always with you. Wherever my devotees think of me, there I am."

Showered with the wisdom, love and mercy of Gurudeva, the people returned to their usual activities. Silence settled on Khatu and for a while the village seemed like a nest abandoned by the birds, or like a pond without water.

Sri Revat Singhji vowed to visit Mahaprabhuji every day and this he did, walking several kilometres to the ashram through the desert. As a Ruler he was not permitted to go alone and so was always accompanied by servants and entourage. Even though there were camels and horses in his train, he never rode.

"If God has granted you this comfort, why don't you make use of it?" Mahaprabhuji once asked him.

"In the first place, Master, none of it belongs to me," Sri Revat Singhji replied, "and secondly it is proper to practise humility before a Saint. Before you I am not a king but a servant. Therefore I enter your kingdom on foot."

The maharaja's subjects were very proud of their Ruler's humble devotion to his Guru .

In past times, kings practised yoga and led pious lives. Unfortunately, this way of life was abandoned. Spiritual knowledge declines until Gurudeva comes to the world again, to revive and restore the knowledge of God and Divine wisdom.

In The Bhagavad Gita (Ch. 4, V. 2) it is written:

"Only the raj rishis [7] realized these principles of bhakti and gyana [8] in their kingdom. For a long time this yoga disappeared from earth, but whenever a Divine incarnation appears on earth, gyana y oga [9] is re-awakes."

Thakur Revat Singhji never tired of praising his Guru .

"The grace of the Master is the highest, the source of true fortune in the world. I am ignorant, I am nothing. Only through the grace of Gurudeva have I been allowed to expe­rience this. It is the Satguru who gives everything, all others, no matter how powerful or rich, are mere beggars at his door. Only the blessing of the Satguru brings peace."

"It is true," Mahaprabhuji said to him. "This knowledge is only granted to those who reach atma gyana [10] , through bhakti yoga [11] . The only beings who truly deserve to be called human are those who realize and understand their human existence. Others call themselves human but are little more than animals. Animals eat, drink, sleep and reproduce. How are some people different from the beasts?

"Only humans have the capacity to realize the Omni­present and Omniscient God of the universe who dwells in the hearts of all creatures. May everyone awaken to the love of the Supreme within them, for that Divine power rests in everyone. But without realization, the door to liberation remains closed. You may study all holy texts and memorise the Vedas , but until you realize your own Self this knowledge is useless.

"Always keep your mind on God and constantly cultivate your reverence for him. The unchangeable, the eternal exists within you! As long as you don't feel God's presence in your heart you will be like a spoon lying in honey, noticing nothing of the sweet taste that surrounds it. Only Gurudeva can give enlightenment to the disciple. He transfers Divine Light and energy and the disciple develops love in the heart and experiences the indescribable feeling of being blessed. Only due to this awakening can God realization succeed. This is only possible between a true Divine Master and a totally committed disciple."

Such are the teachings that Mahaprabhuji granted to his disciple Sri Revat Singhji. In his satsangs , Mahaprabhuji clearly taught the message of the Vedas and other holy texts through the singing of bhajans and using parables and other examples from everyday life. In this way, through simple words, all were able to understand and grasp the essence contained within.



Even in modern times superstition and faith in oracles is widespread. Many charlatans and swindlers exploit such superstition and take advantage of innocent people by pretending to be mediums or prophets.

An oracle sits before a statue of a Goddess surrounded by sweet-smelling joss sticks and to the suggestive, insistent beat of drums, puts himself into a trance. With great emotion he then begins to speak and prophesise. What it mostly amounts to is a berating of the poor believer for the unknown offences he has committed against the Goddess, in atonement for which he must offer as sacrifice a sheep, goat or buffalo. The ignorant believer hastens to bring the appropriate sacrifice and in his effort to pacify the angered Goddess, many animals are killed. These animals are then eaten, for the oracles do not waste the meat.

In India it is almost universally believed that it’s wrong to take a life merely to satisfy your taste buds. Rather than openly defy this belief, certain people have devised these pseudo-religious oracles as an excuse to eat meat. In this way they cheat many innocent people, including the poor who must donate expensive animals and make them foolish by encouraging blind and useless belief.

This oracle nonsense was particularly widespread in the Nagaur district. One day Mahaprabhuji called Sri Revat Singhji and instructed him to forbid the practice of the oracles.

"The bhopas have a very bad influence on the people of your land. Money is taken and animals are sacrificed to satisfy the desire to eat meat. You must put an end to those deplorable practices. God is kind and full of love and would never demand the sacrifice of blood. These sacrifices commanded by the bhopas, arise from inner darkness and a superstition nurtured by fear. But now all this will end!"

"Gurudeva, I would gladly do this, but the Master of the bhopas always escapes me," Thakur Revat Singhji said. "Kalidasa, as they call him, lives in a cave in the mountains. He is a powerful magician of callous and brutish nature, he enjoys the veneration of the people. Also, they are afraid of him. Many holy men have been defeated by his magical powers and he protects all other bhopas ."

With a smile Mahaprabhuji listened to these words of the thakur .

"Raja, still you have not truly recognised Gurudeva! No harm can come to one who is protected by me. Even if the whole world was against him, not a single hair of his head would be harmed. For even the God of death himself gives way to that one who lives in the protective grace of Gurudeva. Be without fear and have all bhopas arrested! Tell them that only their Master can free them. Many innocent and ignorant people have been despicably deceived, but now this will end. For wherever Gurudeva spreads the Light of Truth, darkness must flee."

As instructed, Thakur Revat Singhji ordered his men to arrest all bhopas . Encouraged by the fact that Mahaprabhuji was protecting them, the men overpowered the bhopas in a surprise attack. The priests invoked their Gods, siddhis and magic powers, but to their great surprise all efforts proved ineffective.

Their Master, Kalidasa, soon heard of their plight and he too called upon his most powerful and protective God and uttered a mighty curse over Mahaprabhuji and the thakur so that they might be killed. But both remained unscathed and instead he lost all his magic powers. All the siddhis he had gained through many years of practice had failed him and were no longer at his disposal.

"I don't understand how this could possibly happen," he thought. "Until today I have always possessed superior powers and now these are ineffective and have even turned against me! If I can no longer protect my disciples and if my power has gone, then what is the meaning of my life? However, I would still like to teach a lesson to that thakur and Mahaprabhuji!"

And with this he once more tried to muster all his magic power and energy and uttered a most devastating curse, but without success. Due to his impotence, Kalidasa felt an unknown anger and the bhopas were deeply disappointed that their Master and protective Gods were unable to free them. They turned to the thakur and made a promise to give up their practices. In accordance with Mahaprabhuji's instructions, the thakur set them free.

The bhopas kept their word and became devotees of Gurudeva and as his disciples, began to lead a pure life pleasing to God. Once they had renounced their despicable deeds, Sri Revat Singhji gave each a piece of fertile farmland at Mahaprabhuji's command so that they could become farmers. Thus the ritual slaughter of animals ended.

Due to his excessive anger and negative thoughts and qualities, Kalidasa was stricken with leprosy. Ultimately he gave up his pride and went to Mahaprabhuji to beg forgiveness. The merciful Gurudeva didn't reproach him but only looked upon him with benevolent grace.

He healed Kalidasa and warned him, "Nothing belongs to you. Follow this truth and direct your thoughts to God."

A truly great soul never looks at the mistakes of others, he only bestows grace and helps everybody.

Thakur Revat Singhji spent more and more time with Gurudeva, filled with that yearning for the Supreme on hearing Mahaprabhuji's Divine wisdom. The friends of the thakur couldn't understand and asked why he spent all day with Mahaprabhuji.. In answer he chanted:



SATGURU DARSHAN DINA NEN THARE RE

My Satguru granted me his Darshan, His sight has changed my existence, My eyes see only him, All my wishes have been fulfilled.

Happily my spirit shouts with joy, Darkness has left my inner Self, The veil of ignorance has been torn away, My mind is pure and clear, Liberated from illusion and worry.

Remaining on earth, the Self is freed From the circle of reincarnations, The messengers of death are driven away.

My Satguru Swami Deep is Hari and Brahman, He is Sarguna and Nirguna, Now his devotee Revat Singh is without fear!

On hearing this song, his friends realized that Thakur Revat Singh was a great and wise man and this, my friends, is the fruit of satsang .





One day Thakur Revat Singhji went to Jodhpur on business. There he met Prince Chatur Singh, a passionate hunter, who asked the thakur , "Why do you never hunt?"

"We received the grace of human life from God and at the same time the gift to discriminate between good and evil deeds," Thakur Revat Singh replied. "At all times our deeds should be directed in this knowledge and the only hunting we should do is  hunting of evil and ignorance within ourselves. Then we will attain Divine blessing. For as long as we harm other creatures we will also suffer. It is written in the Vedas and the shastras : 'One who makes others happy will gain fortune, but whoever does harm will experience sorrow'!"

To further express this truth, he sang the following bhajan :



HE ACHAMBO ESO AVE RE JIVONE JIV SATAVE

Full of pain I see how one being mistreats another, How may that one be lucky who harms others? Happily will live those who love all creatures! The precepts of the Vedas and Saints say: Care for the lives of all creatures, as you would your own, Live without envy and greed, on the wage of honest work.

Sri Satguru Swami Deep Narayan shows the right path to the lost, Sri Revat Singh says, I follow his words and harm no creature.



This bhajan profoundly impressed Chatur Singh and from that moment on he never hunted again. He even renounced eating meat recognising the truth imparted to him by Sri Revat Singhji, that the highest duty of man is to protect all beings — to harm them is a great sin. He realized the meaning of the truth, that the foremost duty of the kshatriya [13] is to fight against evil. The worst karma is caused by the following deeds:

To kill, steal, rob or destroy property belonging to others,

To lie, cheat or to turn others away from human dharma [14] .

Chatur Singh passed on the teachings of Thakur Revat Singhji and inspired by his genuine change, many other people came to follow Mahaprabhuji's teachings.





On the full-moon night in the month of Kartika (October), Mahaprabhuji celebrated a great satsang with bhajans and kirtan s in the Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram. Among the people who had gathered there were four thieves, expecting to gain much on this night. Of course, Mahaprabhuji divined their intentions, but did not reveal their presence to his devotees.

Thakur Revat Singh had also joined the celebration and the two camels which he had brought were tied up outside the ashram .

At midnight when all were singing with full fervour, the four thieves crept unnoticed out of the ashram , untied the camels and made off with them.

On discovering the theft, the satsang visitors became restless. Mahaprabhuji calmed them.

"Don't be concerned about the camels, I assure you they won't be lost. Let us continue with our satsang !"

But the people were unable to settle.

"Come to the ashram gate and convince yourselves of my words," he said.

With this they all ran to the entrance and to their surprise saw the thieves circling the ashram on the backs of the camels.

The thieves thought they had already covered a good distance, for one of them was heard to say, "We’ve been riding for so long now but strangely enough we haven’t passed one village or house. Something seems to be wrong!"

"It's so dark I can't see a thing!" another said.

The others agreed and complained of the darkness which obstructed their view. Still they laboured under the impression that they were far from the ashram .

Suddenly they were stopped as the satsang visitors ran to them and seizing the reins of the camels, led them back to Mahaprabhuji.

To their horror, the thieves realized that the darkness which had descended upon them was caused by the loss of their sight.

Wailing and crying, they bowed down to Mahaprabhuji.

"O Gurudeva, forgive us. In our ignorance we fell into thieving. Please be gracious and grant sight to our eyes."

"Promise to give up stealing from now on and live by means of honest work. If you obey this you will regain your sight," Mahaprabhuji replied. "If you commit another theft you will surely lose your sight for the remainder of your life."

All four thieves humbly promised to steal no more and the compassionate Master restored sight to their eyes. Nevertheless, after some time one of these men reverted to his old habits. He lost his sight immediately and remained blind for the remainder of his life.

And so it is proved that the words of a Divine soul are infallible, they are the keys to truth.



Thakur Revat Singh and the villagers of Bari Khatu were deeply touched by the satsangs of Mahaprabhuji and they wished that he spend the four months of the monsoon season at their village. Sri Revat Singhji and others proceeded to Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram to invite Mahaprabhuji to come and stay with them.

Respectfully greeting him they presented a letter of petition, signed by all, containing the following words: "Sri Mahaprabhuji, we humbly ask you to bless our village with your presence during the time of the monsoon."

Mahaprabhuji warmly accepted their invitation and replied to the thakur : "God is always in the hands of the bhaktas . I will fulfil their wish and spend this time in Bari Khatu. However, I would like to stay at a place just outside the village so that all may come to me at any time."

"Gurudeva, to the west of the village, at the foot of a hill, there is a house near a large banyan tree," Sri Revat Singhji answered. "Please accept this as your abode, for it offers enough space for all who wish to visit you. If you lack anything needed to make you comfortable, I will happily provide it."

To the joy of all citizens of Bari Khatu, Mahaprabhuji agreed. The villagers and the thakur began to make preparations for Mahaprabhuji's stay in their village.

A garden was created and named "Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Bagichi" in honour of Gurudeva. This garden and the house where Mahaprabhuji stayed still exist.

Early on the morning of the 11th day of the month Ashadh, Thakur Revat Singhji and other dignitaries collected Mahaprabhuji from the ashram . In a decorated coach they escorted him, with great ceremony, to the village. The men and women of Bari Khatu welcomed him and joined the moving procession as it made its way to the house beside the Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Bagichi. Mahaprabhuji settled there and held satsang .

His words of Divine wisdom fell on those present like celestial nectar and, liberated from all worldly problems, the people bathed in Brahman's bliss. Every day hundreds of devotees gathered to share in this blessing. The people of Bari Khatu still speak of the Divine grace which they experienced at that time.

Mahaprabhuji was a fountain of wisdom and joy. It did not matter if he spoke about the Vedas , The Upanishads , The Bhagavad Gita or other holy texts, as he always imparted the knowledge from these in a simple manner to the village people, often illustrating the teachings of the Saints and philosophers in parables so that all could easily understand. Swamis, sadhus , spiritual seekers and other villagers came in great number from far distances to share in the satsang of Gurudeva and thus the four months of the monsoon passed in an atmosphere of harmony, filled with great wisdom and joy.

To celebrate the end of his stay in the village, a grand satsang was held on the day of the full moon. On this occasion the thakur presented a letter of thanks to Mahaprabhuji from all devotees of Bari Khatu:

OM  SRI  DEEP  NARAYAN  NAMAHA

We greet you, Om Sri Deep Narayan

"Srimad Paramhansa Paribrajakacharya Jagadguru [16] , Eternal Master who removes the darkness of ignorance, the Supremely worshipped Maharaj, thousandfold praised Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji! Full of grace, you have granted the blessing of your holy presence here in Bari Khatu.

As the fruit of good deeds in thousands of former lives, we have been blessed with the Darshan and Satsang of such a great soul. O Mahaprabhuji, Ocean of Mercy, the wisdom from your lips has dispelled the darkness of ignorance! With your holy words, you have given the essence and meaning of The Upanishads , of Sri Shankaracharya, Nyaya and Mimamsa Shastra , the Puranas , Yoga and all holy texts accessible to us. In parables and stories you gave us clarity of understanding. Countless glorious Satsangs you bestowed upon us, filling the listeners of this world and others with great joy. This will never fall into oblivion! Preserver of Dharma, Maryada Purushottama JagatGuru! [17]

Your lotus-like words impart knowledge of our true Self. We were in the ocean of ignorance, shrouded in pain, greed, anger, egoism, jealousy and passion. You gave us liberation from this. Only by your grace have we realized our True form. Our thanks will never cease. In the name of all citizens we thank you a thousandfold! O compassionate Gurudeva! We ask that you continue to give us your Satsang and your Divine wisdom and be lenient in the face of our mistakes."

Berisal Kamdar, Secretary to Thakur Revat Singh



For several generations the rajas of Bari Khatu had no descendants and therefore had to appoint heirs by adoption. Thakur Revat Singh had also remained childless. His subjects however, hoped that their Ruler would beget a child of his own by the grace of Mahaprabhuji, in whose Omnipotence they all faithfully believed.

It was at a satsang that the thakur stood up and spoke these words to Mahaprabhuji.

"My beloved benefactor. I have now grown old and with your consent would like to adopt an heir. Please choose the boy whom shall be my descendant."

Smiling, Mahaprabhuji only shook his head and said, "It's not necessary for you to adopt a child, for you and your wife will soon have a son to inherit your kingdom."

A medical doctor from Delhi, Dr. Ramesh Chandra Sethi, was present at the satsang .

"Sir, please excuse my interruption, but according to my medical knowledge it would be impossible for this couple to have a child at their age."

"Doctor, your science and my science obviously represent two different points of view," Mahaprabhuji answered. "Your science maintains that they will get no children, while mine assures you that they will be blessed with not one, but even more children."

Mahaprabhuji then instructed Thakur Revat Singhji to perform a fire ceremony. In this ceremony, mantras from the ancient Vedas and Puranas are chanted by pandits [18] while offerings of different kinds of wood, oil-seeds, grains and ghee (clarified butter) are thrown repeatedly into the fire. The purpose is to physically and spiritually uplift and transform the individual and the environment.

The thakur carried out this order although even to him the fulfilment of such a prophecy seemed improbable.

But, as always, Mahaprabhuji's words proved true and after nine months an heir was born to the thakur . The news spread like wildfire throughout the district and all rejoiced at this happy event. Thoroughly overjoyed, the thakur distributed donations and gifts to the poor and all those in need.

A great celebration took place and Mahaprabhuji distributed prasad and named the little prince "Sri Abhaya Singh." Later two more children were born to the thakur — a son named Amar Singh and a daughter called Anupkunwar. Today all three still live in Bari Khatu. They became devout disciples of Mahaprabhuji and faithfully cherish and follow his teachings.

It was thus that the grace which Mahaprabhuji promised to bestow on the thakur was realized.

In his gratitude, Thakur Revat Singh gave 500 hectares of land to his Master. Mahaprabhuji refused to keep this for himself and instead distributed it to poor farmers, for which some disciples criticised him.

"Master, you have given all the land to the poor although it was intended for the ashram . Would it not have better served the guests and disciples of the ashram ? There are many ashrams throughout India which are sustained by the yield of the estates given to them by Rulers. An ashram requires land."

Patiently Mahaprabhuji listened to their arguments and then he began to speak.

"All men, holy and wise, seekers and aspirants, rich and poor, come into this world with a certain destiny which has been established according to deeds in former lives. This ashram will never be without means, as Lord Shiva himself protects it and all Riddhis [19] and Siddhis [20] are always at its service. Consider that all monasteries and temples that own land are forever involved in unnecessary disputes. The courts are constantly busy because property always causes quarrels.

"Many people come to me asking for my blessing to win such cases but I always tell them that they should trust in their destiny. Whatever is written in our destiny will be granted to us, so why should we worry?

"Renunciation is the key to bliss, but that does not mean you can neglect your duties. True renunciation is giving up your delusions, wrong imaginations, diversions and desires. It means to obtain contentment and preserve God in one's own heart. Live happily. Human life is precious, therefore do not waste it senselessly. One who has renounced worldly property does not require money.

"Remember that wealth and property are not everlasting. After death, only our karmas accompany us. I repeat this to the people again and again but still they disregard my words and continue to run after their fantasies and desires. They are all deceived by maya ! Listen, property brings sorrow, renunciation leads to freedom. Nothing belongs to you. Remember this truth and direct your thoughts to God!"

Mahaprabhuji then sang:



DUNYA KE JAGDAND ME PHAS GAYE JIVA ANANT

Myriads of beings are caught in the worldly mire, The wise ones try hard to show them Reality But they do not understand.

Even the Saints are helpless, In the time of Kali Yuga even the Brahmins fall victim to illusion, And the preservers of faith lose their way, Swami Deep Narayan says, if preaching is useless You had better keep silent.

The years passed in peace and harmony until one day Thakur Revat Singh told his subjects of Bari Khatu, "My brothers and sisters! Through the grace of Mahaprabhuji I've been informed that in one year I will leave this body. It is my great fortune to have had Gurudeva, the incarnation of the Supreme, to guide me across the ocean of this world. Through his blessings all my worldly and spiritual desires have been fulfilled. May Mahaprabhuji grant me his holy darshan in each rebirth!"

On hearing these words from their Ruler, the citizens of Khatu felt quite anxious, as they had grown to like the thakur and knew that it would be almost impossible to find another Ruler like him.

Two months before the predicted time, Thakur Revat Singh longed to have Mahaprabhuji with him. And so it was that Mahaprabhuji accepted the thakur 's invitation and for two months held satsang in the palace. I was also permitted to take part in this visit, which occurred during 1950. In this time Mahaprabhuji gave enlightenment to Thakur Revat Singhji and imparted to him the highest knowledge of Truth and the Supreme.

The day before he left his body, the thakur spoke to all citizens of Bari Khatu:

"All my life you were faithfully by my side. My life's journey was successful due to you and the blessing of Gurudeva. Now the journey ends and tomorrow morning at four o'clock, I shall say farewell. But you shall not mourn for me because I will unite with the formless Gurudeva, Sat­chit­ananda Brahman [21] . If ever I was unjust to anyone, I ask for their forgiveness."

He folded his hands and bowed to those gathered. All were deeply touched and their eyes filled with tears.

A large satsang was held which lasted all night and at exactly four o'clock in the morning, Thakur Revat Singhji bowed to Mahaprabhuji with folded hands and prayed.

"Mahaprabhuji, by your grace I have crossed the ocean of maya . Through you I became happy and obtained rich blessings. I was permitted to serve all these people here and to be near you at the same time. Now as I bid my farewell to this world, you have granted me the benevolence of your presence. Please bless me, my Lord."

Mahaprabhuji blessed him and the thakur chanted OM and left his physical body.

In memory of Thakur Revat Singh a monument of marble was erected outside the village of Pong near Bari Khatu. It still stands today.

## [Discord Between Muslim and Hindu](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/1559-discord-between-muslim-and-hindu)

In Pushkar frequently there was strife between Hindus and Muslims. Many Hindu pilgrims came to Pushkar, which is called the " Guru of pilgrims ." It has the only Brahma Temple in the world. A famous Muslim shrine called "Dargah" in Ajmer is just some kilometres away, therefore the two groups can hardly help coming into close contact. In those times when they are most ardently pious, religious altercations naturally arise.

Mahaprabhuji was in Pushkar on one such occasion and the quarrelling parties sensibly decided to ask him to mediate, for he was well known in the city and respected by Muslim and Hindu alike. They presented their differing points of view in a noisy argument, but raising his hand for silence, Mahaprabhuji admonished them.

"Brothers, what turbulence you have brought here! Your quarrel is senseless. You labour under a grave mistake if you think you are enemies, just because you follow different religions. You must learn instead to love one another like brothers, for we are all children of the One, Divine Father. God dwells in the heart of all living beings whether Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Christian or Jew. If you truly practise your faith, you will come to God by either route."

Mahaprabhuji then sang to them:



SUNJO HINDU OR MUSHALA RE

Listen, Hindus and Muslims! There is no liberation in fighting, Neither side can ever win so.

The Hindus have forgotten Rama And the Muslims have lost Allah, And both have strayed from the path, HE is Rama, HE is Divine, HE is Allah as well, Thus spoke the Saints, but the people will not understand, They would rather run about and shout.

May the Muslim hurry on his way to Mecca, May the Hindu spring into the Ganges for his holy bath, May the Pandit study his books And the Kaji [1] ponder the Koran — Without knowledge all their doing is foolish.

Only the self-realized One, The Muslim as well as the Hindu, Can see Oneness in the manifold, Please, real seeker, take my point, It heralds from the infinite Omnipresence.



The poetical expression of this bhajan may only be appreciated in the original Hindi language. It deeply penetrated the hearts of the quarrelling pilgrims, as the realization of their unity in God reconciled them.

Mahaprabhuji seldom visited a temple. Asked why he did not worship in temples, he answered, "Statues, pictures, churches, mosques and temples only serve as objects of inspiration. In reality God is within you. Your body is the true temple of Divine love. The houses of God are kept as symbols so that these inner realities are not forgotten, but they are not meant to be confused with reality."



MERA DEVARA ME DEVA BAHAR NAHI BHATKUN

My inner temple is the dwelling of the Lord, I will not wander out, The Divine is within me and I accept no illusions.

He is neither in Kashi [2] nor Mathura, he is in my heart, Only the wise know this, not the ignorant, He is neither in Priyag nor in Haridwar, Without knowledge, all is fruitless, Bathing in the Ganges does not bring liberation, I know my inner Self, neither Karma nor destiny can affect me, Broken is the veil of illusion.

My Satguru has awakened the Swan of my Soul and freed it, He peeled away the last inner layer, Swami Deep says: my Revered Guru, Bhagwan Sri Devpuriji Revealed to me the Divine Self, There I found my realization and inner peace.



"Mahaprabhuji, you yourself are the temple and place of pilgrimage," they acknowledged. "Your presence has removed our ignorance."

Thereupon Mahaprabhuji asked them, "Why do you travel to temples to experience God? God is forever within you. Listen."

He sang another bhajan :



TERA DEVARA ME DEVA BAHAR MATA DOLE

God dwells within your own temple, Do not wander outside, The mountain is concealed within a single mustard-seed.

God is Omnipresent, like fire in wood and oil in sesame, The Satguru reveals reality. Follow his words.

Like the musk-deer that wanders in the forest Searching in vain the source of his own smell, All of mankind is deluded, Only that one who meets the Satguru Can perceive the illusion.

Satsang is the only way to happiness, Whoever attends, is loved by the Lord And freed from Karma and ignorance, That river of knowledge removes all impurity, The Saints are God-incarnate, Leading aspirants across the worldly ocean And opening their inner eye of knowledge.

Mahaprabhuji says: Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto the Truth and remember the Lord!



Gratefully the pilgrims absorbed this song and respectfully bowed to Mahaprabhuji before returning to their homes in peace.

Wherever Mahaprabhuji went, people would automatically gather around him, drawn like bees to nectar. They liked the way he taught and the way he lived. All his actions and words were simple but everyone could sense the purity and sincerity with which he guided people to the experience of the truth and not blind faith. He made no distinctions between people because of caste or religion and so spiritual seekers of all social classes and religious faiths were equally attracted to him.

Dear readers, here I would like to mention something about perseverance and sadhana to those who are on the path of spirituality. Initially everyone is enthusiastic and con­scientiously performs his or her practices. However, most soon succumb to one of two basic mistakes. Either they decide that it’s impossible for them to reach the aim and thus give up, or else they consider that they are already perfect and think they need not practise any more. What a grave mistake! Mahaprabhuji used to say that practice was necessary no matter what stage one had reached.

"Water should always flow," he said. "If it stands still it stagnates and begins to stink."

The well from which water is drawn is always replenished with that pure, fresh water of the spring. But still water becomes foul and undrinkable. Continuity is a natural law of life, stagnation is death. What we commonly call a "standstill" is actually a step taken back, by no means does it mean stability. If we wish to avoid stagnating, or going backward in development, we need to keep practising whatever psychophysical, mental or spiritual discipline we believe in.

We should faithfully continue our sadhana day by day throughout  our entire life, whether we are disciples or Masters. Dear readers, Mahaprabhuji also continued to practise certain yoga techniques. If even he, Perfection itself, still practised, then how necessary it is for us!

However, there are great differences regarding practice. Without correct knowledge the aspirant can fall into all sorts of peculiar or harmful disciplines and the following story is about this.



[1] Kaji = Muslim scribe

[2] Kashi , Mathura , Priyag and Haridwar are the four most important places of pilgrimage in India.

## [Mahaprabhuji's Journey Through Pali](https://www.lilaamrit.org/disciples/1561-mahaprabhujis-journey-through-pali)

After leaving Pushkar, Mahaprabhuji did not directly return to his ashram but stayed a while just outside the village of Khatu in the Sri Deep Narayan Bagichi, where he held satsangs morning and night under the large green banyan tree.

During this time, Swami Shankar Puri arrived from Bola Guda and he was warmly welcomed by Sri Revat Singh, who was pleased at the opportunity to discuss yoga and spirituality with him. Eventually Swami Shankar Puri told Sri Revat Singh the reason for his visit, which was to invite Mahaprabhuji to the Pali District and stay at the Bola Guda Ashram.

The thakur was unhappy at the thought of being separated from Mahaprabhuji.

Swami Shankar Puri said, "You know that Gurudeva is everywhere at all times. Whenever you merely think of him, he is with you. Besides," he added, "you should not be selfish, for we also desire the blessing of his physical presence."

So Swami Shankar Puriji put his request to Mahaprabhuji, who graciously agreed.

His departure from Khatu was festive and well-organised. Some devotees from the railroad had arranged a special train for him and he travelled accompanied by an escort. The first stop of the journey was Jodhpur, where he was warmly welcomed. Devotees from Umed Palace, the residence of the maharaja , took him to the palace and with great reluctance they let him go after one week. He boarded the train and travelled to Somesar Western Railway Station, which is about 10 kilometres from Bola Guda and from there he walked to the ashram .

How the people of the villages around rejoiced at having Sri Mahaprabhuji with them, forming a great queue to see him and receive his blessing or darshan. Many swamis and yogis also came, as did four to five hundred people every day who desired to have contact. The local lord Sri Ram Singhji, provided hospitality for the many visitors. The people of Bola Guda also helped to care for the guests.

In the satsangs , Mahaprabhuji was inspired to sing many wonderful bhajans , the poetic outpourings from the depths of his soul. The nephew of Ram Singhji was a young man named Kishnan Singh, who loved Mahaprabhuji very much and sat by his side to write down his poetry. It is due to him alone that the songs from this period of Mahaprabhuji's life have been saved for us.

Representatives from the villages in the area got together and decided that if Mahaprabhuji would agree, every village should have him visit in turn, thus creating a festive procession over the whole region.



Day by day the people listened to Mahaprabhuji's golden teachings, such as the "sacred swan swallows pearls" [1] and almost all citizens received mantra initiation as Mahaprabhuji distributed a great wealth of blessings.

Sri Sultan Singh and his wife, Srimati Radhadevi, were deeply and humbly devoted to Mahaprabhuji. One day while he was holding satsang in their home, he turned to Srimati Radhadevi and requested her to read a poem from the bhajan book. Radhadevi folded her hands and softly spoke.

"Lord, I regret very much that I can neither read or write. The letters in this book are a great mystery to me."

"What would you do if you could read?" Mahaprabhuji asked.

"I would read all your books and bhajans !" she answered.

Mahaprabhuji handed her his Gita .

"I bless you so that from now on you may read my books. Open this book now and read aloud!"

With full confidence, Radhadevi took the book as prasad from his hands, opened it and began to read. According to her wish, from that time on Srimati Radhadevi was able to read all Mahaprabhuji's books. But only his, for the letters of others remained illegible to her.

Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji can give the gift of both paravidya (spiritual knowledge) and aparavidya (worldly knowledge). However, we must also pay homage to the recipient as well, for this process requires two. Without the readiness to receive, the Divine stream would come to a stop.

The seat on which Mahaprabhuji sat that day, the book through which the miracle was manifested, the whole room — all have been preserved as it was, in remembrance of that occasion which brought such joy to Srimati Radhadevi.



In the village of Shivas a devotee named Devi Singhji came to Mahaprabhuji's satsang and sat praying in Mahaprabhuji's presence. In the middle of his devotions the one great sorrow of his life returned to his mind: he had only one child. As happy children are the greatest blessing for every family, he repeatedly prayed for the extension of his family, but nothing happened. Now in silence he repeated his wish to Gurudeva.

Mahaprabhuji heard this prayer.

"Don't worry," he said. "In the kingdom of Gurudeva all wishes are fulfilled. You will be blessed with two sons and one daughter."

For the devout and spiritual Devi Singhji, the words of Mahaprabhuji were the words of God and he never doubted their truth. Today he lives with his wife and four children, who are firm devotees of Mahaprabhuji.

Greatly blessed, Devi Singhji was once more to experience Mahaprabhuji's grace. His well had gone dry and he could not water his fields. Again he offered a silent prayer of help to Gurudeva and again Mahaprabhuji heard.

"The people of this world find no end to their desires," Mahaprabhuji said. "But it is a universal law that the thirsty one who comes to the water, shall have their thirst quenched. From today on you will have plenty of pure, sweet water."

And even today, at the hottest time of year when water is scarce and other wells have dried up, the well of Devi Singhji flows abundantly. He named this well Sri Deep Sagar, which means "the Ocean of Mahaprabhuji."

God fulfils all sincere wishes of his devotees. Nothing is impossible for him.

During a stay with the Maharaja of Jodhpur, Sri Devi Singhji was taking care of Mahaprabhuji's needs. One morning Mahaprabhuji wanted to take a bath and Sri Devi Singh was making the necessary preparations. A bathtub was brought and filled with water, but Devi Singhji was worried that it would be too small for Mahaprabhuji. While he was thinking this, Mahaprabhuji entered the room and inquired what was troubling him.

"Gurudeva, I'm afraid that the tub is too small for you and when you step inside the water will flow over."

Mahaprabhuji only smiled.

"Don't worry, you will see that not a drop of water will be lost. The tub is big enough for me."

Mahaprabhuji then stepped into the bath, sat down and stretched. Before the astonished eyes of Sri Devi Singhji, Mahaprabhuji's body became smaller and smaller, until it was the size of a child. Speechless, the disciple stood in awe at this transformation and watched in devotion Mahaprabhuji's Lila , the Divine Play. In the form of a child he frolicked in the water and took pleasure in bathing for more than an hour. When he again stepped from the tub, his body resumed its normal size.

In respect and gratitude at being permitted to witness this miracle, Sri Devi Singhji bowed deeply before Gurudeva.



After his stay in Jodhpur, Mahaprabhuji accepted an invitation to Keshersinghji Guda, the village of his very devout disciple, Thakur Raghunath Singh. Inspired by the pure and spiritual life of their Ruler, the citizens of this village were requesting Mahaprabhuji for his blessing and mantra initiation.

Thakur Raghunath Singh was wondering which useful gifts he could give Mahaprabhuji for his ashram when the thought of chillies came to his mind. Most Western readers have no idea how indispensable chillies are to the Indian household. Great quantities of these burning red and green pods disappear daily into Indian cooking pots!

Anyhow, this thought was troubling the thakur for in that year there had been a poor yield of chilli crops due to drought. Consequently, chillies were being sold at a very high price and he himself had not gathered even one.

Mahaprabhuji perceived these thoughts.

"Why do you worry about the chillies?" he said with a smile. "With the blessing and presence of Gurudeva, all things are possible. Lead me to the field where you planted chillies."

Walking to the field, the thakur told Mahaprabhuji that for two years now he had gathered none. On arriving at the field they saw only withered stalks jutting from the ground. The plants had died and vermin had eaten the roots.

Mahaprabhuji looked around him.

"Go and water the field and the chillies will grow again."

Though the thakur was unable to imagine this, he didn’t dare ignore Mahaprabhuji's instructions and so diligently watered the inanimate stalks. Behold, the next day the field began to look green and the chillies started growing in abundance. Seven days later, three quintals of chillies of the best quality were gathered from the field (one quintal = 100 kilograms).

Mahaprabhuji was asked to say something of this wonder.

"Dear brothers, the garden of Gurudeva is forever green! To keep it fresh requires only the water of love and devotion. We are all flowers in God's garden. There we blossom and grow if only we turn our hearts towards him so that we may receive his life-giving light."

Sri Raghunath Singh's eldest son, Bhanwar Singh, had been married for some years but was still childless. His mother was especially sad, for like all mothers she wished for grandchildren and accordingly decided to ask for Mahaprabhuji's help.

"Will I ever see the children of my son playing in the garden?" she asked.

"In two years a grandson will play in your home and he will have the name of Govinda Singh," Mahaprabhuji answered.

This prophecy also came true and today the family retains a deep veneration for Mahaprabhuji, as does Govinda Singh himself.



After staying with Raghunath Singhji, Mahaprabhuji proceeded to the village of Akhey-Raj-Guda, where he was invited by a farmer Sri Kala Ramji, to give satsang . This farmer was greatly devoted to Mahaprabhuji and was spiritually highly advanced.

Some days before his death he told his family and friends the day on which he would return to the kingdom of Gurudeva. He instructed them not to mourn or grieve, for he considered this a joyous event.

At the exact time stated, he left the world and the night before his farewell they celebrated a satsang . At sunrise the next morning, as usual he went to the well to take a wash and then offered a prayer to Mahaprabhuji and distributed prasad to all present.

"Dear brothers and sisters," he spoke. "If I have done any of you any wrong at any time, I beg your forgiveness. Now I will say farewell and the flame of my life will unite with Gurudeva."

With the prayer, " OM Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji Ki Jay !" he once more bowed before the picture of Mahaprabhuji at his altar and then left the body.

As had been his wish, he received the funeral of a swami .

Mahaprabhuji's disciples attained liberation irrespective of their origin. Whether swami , peasant, nobleman or beggar, each was a mukta purusha , a liberated soul.



On invitation from his devotees Puruhit Virdhi Singh, Devi Singh, Mohabbat Singh and some others, Mahaprabhuji visited the village of Ghat. It was estimated that about 200 people would gather at the satsang and it was planned that halva would be distributed as prasad . But when the message of Mahaprabhuji's arrival had spread, thousands came in order to receive his blessing. The hosts felt helpless, for how should they care for so many people?

Mahaprabhuji Divined their thoughts.

"Don't be concerned," he said. "In the kingdom of Gurudeva there is always perfection. God cares for all. Everyone receives nourishment from him."

Full of confidence in the words of their Gurudeva, they gave out the halva that had been prepared for two hundred people and lo and behold it fed two thousand and even some was left over!



[1] There is an Indian proverb which says, "Like the Hansas gorging pearls"; hansa = swan, symbol of the soul, pearls = symbol of the Divine words of wisdom

[2] halva = traditional Indian sweet made from semolina

## [Searching for God](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/1579-searching-for-god)

Blessed Selves, dear readers! It's not proper to praise yourself, as there is neither pleasure nor good in extolling your own virtues. It is far more pleasant to write about the achievements of others. However, as author of this book I should also speak of my personal experiences with Mahaprabhuji and about the many wonders that I had the opportunity to witness with my own eyes. The time that I spent at Mahaprabhuji's side was certainly the most beautiful and precious of my life.

Karna, the great hero of ancient India, once introduced himself by saying, "The circumstances of my birth, nobility, colour or family, have been determined by my fate, but my actions are under my present control. With these I create my own future and it is within my power to set my goals. Therefore only my accomplishments should stand as recommendation of my person and these are thus my introduction."

A swami’s spiritual devotion, power, progress in yoga and spiritual development serve as his introduction. Therefore I would prefer to have you know me personally however, since we are not meeting in person but on paper, I will give a few details about my childhood and development.

I was born in the Pali district of Rajasthan, in the village of Nipal on September 11, 1923 and given the name Tekchanda Garg. My father was Pandit Sri Lalchandji Garg, a learned astrologer and humble devotee of Lord Shiva and Lord Rama. He led the life of a brahmarishi [1] .

My mother, Srimati Sarasvatidevi Garg, had a very pure, spiritual nature. She was the epitome of kindness and, like Mahaprabhuji's mother, she would go hungry herself before she would turn away anyone from her door. Since her childhood she was especially devoted to Lord Krishna and some of my earliest memories are of my mother telling us children (there were six of us) stories about him. She would tell us again and again that devotion to God is more important than life itself.

"Never lose your devotion," she said. "Always keep searching for God. Live in this world in harmony and fulfilment of your duty to God. He has given us life that we may spend it in devotion and love for all. This life should not be wasted on meaningless things. Serving the poor and those in need is the highest principle of right religion. Parents are the children's Guru s. They mould them for the future."

Five generations ago in my family, there was a great and famous karma yogi named Ami Chandji and often my mother would tell us stories about him. He was a siddha , one that possesses siddhis or supernatural powers and my mother always emphasised that all his powers were the result of his hard work. In India we have a saying, "Work is worship," and this my mother believed with her whole heart.

Ami Chandji was well-known and he impressed many people with his way of life and vast powers. He could, for instance, predict the future with unerring accuracy. The maharaja of Ghanerav was impressed by these abilities and gave him a large piece of land which is still in the family. Once the same ruler gave him an elephant, which he subsequently presented to someone else on the occasion of his son's wedding. That was typical of his selfless, generous nature. Ami Chandji led a very spiritual life and died the death of an advanced yogi by entering mahasamadhi .

From early childhood, I felt strongly attracted to God Krishna. I even used to weep in my relentless longing to see him. I was sent to school but had quite a difficult time there because I could not concentrate on the lessons, my thoughts were always on Lord Krishna.

My father thought that my problem was that I did not like village school, so he sent me to live with my elder sister in the village of Rupawas, where there was a Sanskrit scholar, Sri Gisa Ramji Ghanchi. He was a religious and virtuous man who lived according to his beliefs and principles.

He taught me with great love and my sister, Srimati Phuldeviji and her husband, Sri Krishna Ramji, were also very loving to me. I stayed with them for several years but still my performance at school did not improve.

Eventually I returned to Nipal and began to read and study The Bhagavad Gita every day. I prayed to Surya, the God of the sun and to Durga Mata, the Holy Mother. I used to go on nine-day ( navrati ) fasts for her, but most of all I prayed to Lord Krishna to be merciful and appear to me in my meditations. How bitter were the tears I shed, loving him so much and not being able to see him!

In those moments I frequently had the feeling of a voice within me saying, "Be calm. The Lord will come to you."

One day I was again praying to Lord Krishna from the depths of my soul, "O Krishna, my Beloved God. I have heard your holy promise deep within me. How long must I wait? When will I see you?"

In that moment a glorious vision of the Lord appeared before my inner eye.

"Three and one-half months from today, at ten o'clock in the evening, you will see me with open eyes," he said. "Remember this."

He disappeared, leaving me with an unworldly sense of security. The Lord of Gods Himself, I knew, was going to take care of me.

After some time I went to visit Thakur Ragunath Singhji, a friend of our family who lived in the neighbouring village of Keshersinghji Guda. He was a great devotee of Mahaprabhuji and he introduced me to another of Mahaprabhuji's disciples who was staying with him, Sri Swami Bodhanandji Maharaj. Swamiji looked simple and ordinary but he was a man of great knowledge and deep wisdom. He impressed me with his words and especially with his beautiful singing.

I was so attracted to his satsang that I decided to visit him every day to talk with him and learn from him. Unfortunately, my parents didn't like the idea and so I used to leave the house stealthily at night after they were asleep and would walk the three kilometres to the thakur's house.

The path led me through a forest which was believed to be haunted by ghosts and spirits. To be honest, I never saw or felt anything but I asked Swami Bodhanandji about it.

"Ghosts are only illusions of the mind," he said, "and this is what the whole world is suffering from because we don't yet know our reality."

I remember a significant story about ghosts.

In a little village there lived a farmer who owned two houses, one in the middle of the village and a cottage on the outskirts of town. The villagers thought the cottage was haunted by ghosts and were afraid to walk near it at night.

One day the farmer held a great feast, to which he invited many friends and relatives, some of whom lived great distances away. There was room for all but one of them to stay in the house in the village.

After the feast, this guest walked to the cottage to setlle for the night when suddenly he remembered hearing people speak of the ghost who was supposed to live there. He grew afraid. The closer he came to the cottage, the more nervous he felt. Finally he got there and casting nervous glances all around, hurried inside and bolted all doors and windows. He quickly grabbed a blanket from a pile that was on a corner table, threw the dust cover back over the other blankets and hopped into bed. He pulled the blanket up over his head and tried to sleep, but his fear kept him wide awake and from time to time he would peek out from under the blanket into the dark to make sure no ghost had appeared.

Eventually the moon rose and a moonbeam fell across the room onto the corner table with its pile of blankets. The next time the man lifted the corner of his blanket to look out, his overworked imagination mistook the covered pile of blankets on the table for a ghost and he became so frightened that he couldn't move a muscle.

He screamed for help so loudly that he was heard in the village and people came running to see what was the matter. They couldn't open the doors or windows because he had bolted them from inside and when they called to him to open the door, he screamed back that he couldn't because the ghost was sitting on his chest trying to strangle him.

Finally some brave fellows broke a window and climbed in, but just at that moment the man succeeded in jumping out of bed. He leaped to the door, opened it and ran outside and the others followed him in great haste. "Where's the ghost?" everyone asked and the trembling man pointed to the corner of the room. Everyone stared at the table with covered blankets and saw just what they expected to see — a terrible ghost!  They tried everything they could think of to drive it away. Someone fetched holy water, another brought the priest, but the ghost stood firmly in the corner and wouldn't budge. No-one dared enter the room. The villagers anxiously milled around outside, murmuring confusedly what a powerful and dangerous ghost it was. Finally a man arrived on the scene who didn't believe in ghosts or such things. "But see for yourself," they whispered to him, pointing into the room. The man lit a candle and simply entered the room, where he found nothing but a disordered bed and in the corner, a table with a pile of blankets covered with a sheet. He came out again and told this to the crowd and the people were suddenly ashamed of themselves. The owner of the house remembered that he himself had put the blankets there and the guest recalled how he had taken his blanket from the same pile.

What kind of ghost was that? Where did it come from and where did it go? What made them scared and what ended those feelings? There is only one answer: their own consciousness and this belongs to the world of illusion. Fear arises when there is lack of knowledge. Knowledge doesn't know fear and these ghosts of illusion refuse to disappear as long as knowledge isn't present. The very moment the light of knowledge illuminated the darkness of ignorance, the ghost and fear disappeared.

Swami Bodhanandji explained.

"The reason for all problems and fears is misguided and incorrect concepts of Reality. True wisdom can only be achieved through a holy Master, whom one meets through the mercy of God. But even then, only very few recognise the Master for what he is."

I listened eagerly to his words about holy Masters who dispel ignorance and illusion and then Ragunath Singhji told me about his own Master, Mahaprabhuji.

"My Divine Guru , who is like Lord Vishnu himself, is Sri Mahaprabhuji. With his blessing one can experience the Divine Self, not years or lifetimes from now, but instantly if he so wills it. If you are really searching for a Master, go to him."

## [My First Meeting with Sri Mahaprabhuji](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/1581-my-first-meeting-with-sri-mahaprabhuji)

An intensely powerful longing took hold of me and I could hardly wait to meet this Guru . Fortunately, not too long after that Mahaprabhuji was invited by the maharaja of Jodhpur to that city and so he blessed the people there with his glorious satsangs . Since Jodhpur was at a manageable distance, I decided to take this opportunity to visit him for the first time. Due to the stories of Thakur Ragunath Singhji and Swami Bodhanandji, deep in my heart Mahaprabhuji was already my Master and I wanted to get to know him personally as soon as possible.

I arrived at Jodhpur by train at nine o'clock in the evening and directly went to Mahaprabhuji's satsang . To my utter bewilderment, when I stood before him at ten o'clock, I saw none other than the Lord Krishna to whom I daily prayed in my meditation. My eyes filled with tears and I fell to my knees. I had only one wish and that was to surrender myself completely.

Merciful Mahaprabhuji placed his holy hand on my forehead.

"My son, I have saved you forever. Remember the words I spoke to you three and one-half months ago in your meditation."

As they must, the words of the Lord had come true. From that moment on I dedicated my life to him and promised to stay with him forever. At the age of seventeen I knew I had found the everlasting Light of my life and decided to spend the rest of my life under his merciful care.

## [Ocean of Mercy](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1595-ocean-of-mercy)

Quite a large number of people had gathered at Mahaprabhuji's satsang , when a stranger respectfully came to greet him and then sat down at his side. Subsequently this stranger also shared in the ashram meal. The satsang ended about ten o'clock and all prepared to settle down for the night.

But the stranger waited until all were asleep, then packed his bag with several blankets, pillows and other household items, and quietly stole out of the ashram .

The disciples on watch with Mahaprabhuji had noticed this but when they went to stop him Mahaprabhuji, a great friend of the poor, restrained them.

"Let him go. He takes these things because he is in obvious need of them. Allow him to leave in peace and don't embarrass him. It makes no difference to the ashram since these things don't belong to it. One person brings them and another takes them away. The Lord has wanted it like this."

## [Lord of Mercy, What Should I Do?](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1590-lord-of-mercy-what-should-i-do)

A sadhu from South India by the name of Swami Bhaskarananda was quite conceited about his knowledge. He had Mastered Sanskrit, the language of scholars and he could also quite eloquently express himself in polished Hindi and English. Through impressive speeches he gained influence over many a rich and famous man, even ministers and Maharajas. He was proud and haughty and had declared himself the greatest yogi of all India. Wherever he went he demanded acknowledgement and admiration, often at the expense of others, to prove further evidence of his eloquence.

One day Swami Bhaskarananda heard of the glory of Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji and seized with jealousy, decided to pay him a visit in order to embarrass Mahaprabhuji in front of his disciples.

He arrived at Khatu Ashram in an Impala car. He wore chains and pearls over expensive clothes and on his feet were resplendent gold sandals. In his self-image of Gurudeva, he saw himself as the Jagat Guru and arrogantly stepped before Mahaprabhuji without bowing in proper greeting.

"I will show this Maha Prabhu that a true siddha yogi stands before him," he thought to himself.

Mahaprabhuji welcomed Bhaskarananda with usual friendliness but, with one glance of his Divine eye, shook this haughty one deep within his soul. In that single moment, through his unique Divine power, Mahaprabhuji completely altered the swami 's mind. Beneath the gaze of the Omnipresent, the swami’s ego melted like snow under a hot sun and he realized his faults, the hollowness of pride and vanity, and he was deeply ashamed. During this moment the swami and his companions also felt immersed in an immense sense of happiness.

Humbly, Bhaskarananda bowed before Mahaprabhuji and with folded hands began to speak.

"Lord, I confess to my many bad qualities and habits which despite all efforts I've been unable to give up. You are Omniscient and nothing is concealed from you. I had imagined you as something different from what you are. What I have now been permitted to experience is a Divine miracle, the day of the Lord's immeasurable grace has come for me. Until now I was consumed with ego and pride, but your look has freed me from all worldly wishes and desires, anger, greed, attachment and pride. Joy and peace now fill my inner Self. Your gaze and words have showered my heart with nectar.

"O Lord of Mercy, you have poured your grace on me and blessed me! Please let my soul unite forever with your Divine atma ! I have made life difficult for many sadhus and swamis and with my sharp, sophisticated logic, defeated them in debates on the holy scriptures. I sought to scorn them only to increase my fame. How ashamed I am of my malicious thoughts and words. The veil of illusion which enveloped my soul was dense and impenetrable, but you have removed it. O Lord of Mercy, please tell me, what shall I do now?"

"If your mind has indeed become pure from being here," Mahaprabhuji answered, "then tell me the difference between prabhu and mahaprabhu ."

Swami Bhaskarananda gave this reply.

"Before I saw you it wasn't possible for me to distinguish between prabhu and mahaprabhu , but today in your Divine Light, paravidya (Divine Knowledge) has come my way. Prabhu is the formless God, nirguna , from which the creation of the universe originated, is preserved and is dissolved. According to His law all beings must bear the consequence of their karmas . Through His maya , all beings are bound with karmic fetters.

Mahaprabhu is the Divine incarnation, he stands above prabhu . He conveys knowledge of the atma and paramatma (the self and highest self) and grants self realization to those who are deserving. Though belonging to the highest atma , the atma is separated from it for ages. Only the Satguru, Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji, can reunite them. With the sword of knowledge he cuts the fetters of attachment and illusion and leads all beings to the experience of their true Self.

"Sri Mahaprabhuji accomplishes that which prabhu is unable to do. Those beings created by prabhu suffer from the misery and affliction of this world, however, a true devotee of the Satguru Sri Mahaprabhuji will always be protected."

Mahaprabhuji then spoke to Swami Bhaskarananda.

"Saints and wise men have the duty to free the world from its heavy load, but if they themselves become a burden to it, they are a disaster for the whole universe. The task of a sadhu is to follow the path of righteousness and sacrifice in order to save others from the wrong way. A sadhu shall be like Lord Shiva."

In a bhajan , Mahaprabuji explained the outer appearance of a sadhu :



SHIV RUP SANT MAHARAJ HE

Sadhus are like Shiva, They do not wander singing and dancing from house to house, Doing this they would be treated like beggars, Sadhus neither participate in a stage-play nor attend it, Sadhus do not attend feasts nor gather alms, Sadhus stay in lonely places and accept what God measures out to them.

They do not waste their time with trickery, Nor teach such things to their disciples, They keep away from magic and miracle As they are not interested in being called Siddhas, To decorate the physical body is not at all a sign of Holiness, If a Sadhu lives like a householder he will never be respected.

Swami Deep says: Only such Sadhus should be called Narayana Who may convey the Truth to their devotees.

Mahaprabhuji explained that in order to be liberated from the cycle of birth and death, to avoid passing again through the 8.4 million forms of life, those who are born as humans ought to follow the Satguru and attain self realization. For only through human birth can one use the power of intellect to distinguish between good and bad, right and wrong.

"Therefore don't waste this precious life in the pursuit of wealth, name and fame. The desire to possess all riddhis and siddhis is misleading imagination, for the world resembles a dream. Nothing which you experience in a dream stays with you, it is not Reality. Humans entangled in this world of illusion are in a dream and will continue to dream until that moment when they realize the futility of their actions."

Mahaprabhuji severely admonished Swami Bhaskarananda to adopt the right course of action in his life. Vanity is the greatest enemy of people, it destroys even mighty kings and heroes, he told him. Vanity can entice in many ways: through pride of knowledge, strength, youth, social position, noble birth, beauty or fame. The most dangerous among these is the ego which is nourished by the thirst for fame — it completely destroys the human being.

Mahaprabhuji warned his disciples never to fall prey to the deadly thirst for fame.

"Saints don't strive for might and fame, nor for worldly possessions. They are conscious that this world is temporary, like a dream. They refuse to attach themselves to worldly goods or relations and in this way remain totally independent of the world."

Swami Bhaskarananda praised Mahaprabhuji as the twenty-fifth Incarnation of God [1] .

Then he asked whether Mahaprabhuji had seen all avatars.

"Yes, I know God Rama and God Krishna who preceded me," Mahaprabhuji answered. "I am the eternal, Conscious Brahman, witness of all that happens in the cosmos," The soul stands beyond birth and death only knowing the enlightened, but the ignorant are unconscious of this truth. By the grace of the Satguru, Divine Vision comes to their eyes and the Truth is then recognized. The Satguru's teachings conveys and leads to the true path, sat sanatan dharma . In India and in the whole world there exist thousands of paths and religions which assert their way as the only true path. True dharma , however is free from such fanaticism. That's why perfect realization of Truth is only possible by complete surrender to the Satguru."

Swami Bhaskarananda stayed at the ashram for some time and with great devotion eagerly absorbed Mahaprabhuji's teaching. He then moved to Andhra Pradesh and led the simple life appropriate for a Saint, based on the principles taught to him by Mahaprabhuji.



[1] Until the time of Buddha, Indian philosophy officially acknowledged twenty-four avatars or incarnations of God.

## [Every Living Being Desires a Home](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1604-every-living-being-desires-a-home)

I want to share with you an account of one more lesson that Mahaprabhuji taught me.

India is warm for most of the year, so many rooms don't have glass windows but have a wooden opening instead which can be covered if desired. If left open, the room is easily accessible to many small animals and insects. Therefore, we live in close contact with nature.

A small sparrow had chosen my room to build her nest. Every day I removed the sticks and grass but repeatedly she brought in more.

Once when Mahaprabhuji visited me in my room, I apologised to him for this.

"This little bird is persistent indeed. She never gives up even though every day I clean my room of her sticks."

"But this is completely natural," Mahaprabhuji replied. "Every living being looks for a home in which to settle and raise its young."

In this moment a mouse shot across the room.

"This mouse," I complained, "wakes me during the night with its gnawing and robs me of my sleep. Why can't these creatures stay outside where they belong?"

The second part of my lecture followed.

"You didn't take heed of what I just said," my Master reprimanded. "Each creature seeks a place where it is happy, where it finds food, warmth and shelter. You also do the same. You like to go where friends offer food and a good night's lodging. Therefore don't blame the mouse who also likes comfort. It is just the same with the disciple who comes to the Master where his soul feels comfort. These creatures only do the same."

It is in this way that Gurudeva gave us gentle instructions with each word that he spoke.

## [Pilgrimage to the Himalayas](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1619-pilgrimage-to-the-himalayas)

In 1958 I made a journey to all the important places of pilgrimage in India and as I had heard so much about the beauty and wonders of the Himalayas, I decided to go there and see them for myself. I met many swamis and yogis there and spent several months in the Himalayan caves, not with the intention of carrying out a specific sadhana (because all my desires had already been fulfilled by Mahaprabhuji) but because I wanted to study the yogis who lived there and observe their spiritual lives.

Afterwards I went to Rishikesh, the famous centre of pilgrimage at the foot of the Himalayas and I also lived there for some time with the yogis . I noticed that most tried to live a spiritual life but, as they lacked the guidance of a true Master, their practices weren't really successful.

To live in the Himalayas is not enough. Mahaprabhuji used to observe that there were also many other beings who lived in those mountains.

"Will they also be liberated? Just by staying there and practising asceticism doesn't mean they're treading the path to Realization. Liberation is only achieved through self knowledge and this is gained only by the grace of a true Master."

I also visited Devaprayag, Rudraprayag, Kedarnath, Badrinath and other well-known places of pilgrimage in the Himalayas before returning to Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat.

## [Cure of the Boy Asha Ram](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1591-cure-of-the-boy-asha-ram)

At a satsang held beneath the roof of the sky, I was sitting as usual at the feet of Mahaprabhuji writing down his words, when Asha Ram, the tiny son of Sri Balji Rajput, came running to us. As he was coming to greet Mahaprabhuji, a poisonous snake bit him. Instantly he fell to the ground, unconscious. The snake was a king cobra and there seemed no hope for the boy.

Crying in desperation, the boy's parents bowed before Mahaprabhuji.

"Lord, how can it happen that our child must suffer such a terrible fate? Save him! Save the life of our son!"

"Do not worry," Mahaprabhuji said in a consoling voice. "Give him three spoonfuls of oil and he will be healthy again."

Many doubted his words, but the parents hastened to make the boy drink the exact amount of oil. Shortly thereafter he showed signs of recovery.

Asha Ram still lives today. He became an Ayurvedic doctor and remained a faithful devotee of Gurudeva.

## [The Caste System](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1586-the-caste-system)

During Mahaprabhuji's lifetime the caste system was prevalent in India.

This system was originally developed to prescribe the different roles and duties people had in society. Such roles and duties are the normal requirements in the function of any social order. However, this system was misused to legitimise obvious injustices. The original intention was never to segregate the population into classes from birth, rather to distinguish people according to the activities that they carried out in society.

For example, it is said in The Mahabharata , "If a butcher acts like a brahmin , he is a brahmin and if a brahmin acts like a butcher, so he must be looked upon as a butcher. Therefore give up your vanity and look for the truth in your soul."

In The Bhagavad Gita the human body is symbolically given as an example:

"The head is symbolical for the brahmins , scholars and priests of the land. The kshatriyas or warriors protect the nation, just as the hands protect the body. The vaishyas , merchants and peasants, are compared with the belly of a human and the sudras , or workers, with the feet which carry the whole body wherever it wants to go."

According to law, all Indians have equal rights, but in practice the sudras , or as they were later called, the "untouchables," suffer untold discrimination. Mahaprabhuji did all he could within his power against these injustices and the following incident shows Mahaprabhuji's reaction to the disdainful treatment that was experienced by the members of the lower caste in Indian society.

A farmer from the sudra caste was working in a field on a hot summer's day when, in order to quench his thirst, he sought a water well. The well belonged to a high-caste brahmin family, one of whom had just bathed and was reading a book. The thirsty farmer approached and requested permission to have a drink of water, but the brahmin didn't even bother to answer him.

Three times the farmer repeated his request until the brahmin sneered at him, "Go away, there's no water for you here. You'll make my well impure!"

The farmer moved on and soon came to the mosque of the village, where he addressed the Muslim fakir .

"Please sir, I am thirsty. May I have some water?"

"Son of Allah, help yourself," the friendly Muslim answered. "There's a jug beside the well."

While he was drinking, the farmer thought, "What's the use of being a Hindu if I can expect nothing but rejection from my fellow Hindu brothers?"

So he told the fakir of his experience with the brahmin and expressed the wish to become a Muslim.

The fakir asked the farmer his name.

"I am called Kalu Ram."

"From now on your name shall be Kalu Khan," the fakir said. "Now take this water pot and fill it at the well of the brahmin . If he objects, remember that you own a strong right foot. Go, son of Allah and let's see who can stop you!"

Kalu returned to the water well and wordlessly began to fill the jug.

"Clear off!" the furious brahmin shouted at him. "How dare you dirty my well!"

"What liberties do you take with me?" the farmer shot back. "I'm Kalu Khan, the Muslim!"

And with that he gave the brahmin a swift kick. The proud brahmin flung his book into the air as he tumbled into the sand and the farmer threatened to give him further beatings.

"Spare me!" the brahmin begged, filled with fear. "I didn't know that you had become Kalu Khan. Please forgive my mistake."

News of this incident soon spread throughout the district and came to the ears of Mahaprabhuji. It was the first time that I saw tears in his eyes. He was filled with sadness over the blindness and ignorance of the people of his country.

"They've forgotten the true sense of religion. They're selfish and blind and don't know the meaning of charity. These poor sudras work all day long for a meagre wage and the others only do them wrong. The distinction between high and low caste is a horrible stain on India's karma and the whole country must and does suffer for it."

Mahaprabhuji then set out to do what he could to solve this problem. He called his devotees to a large gathering where all castes came together and he voiced the injustices of the caste system.

With truly Divine power he exposed the error of this discrimination between humans, for humans should meet each other as brother and sister. He spoke of the damage this system, based on wrong assumptions, had created for the inhabitants of all the land. He spoke like a heavenly architect, building brick by brick, word by word, a house of love and understanding in which all could live in peace together.

He then called Kalu Khan and gave him the gift of a sacred thread that brahmins wore.

"My son, you are a human and so possess all rights but if you wish from now on you can be a brahmin ."

Turning to his disciples, Mahaprabhuji continued, "This man was first a sudra, then a Muslim and now I declare him a brahmin . Is he the same person he always was, or is he different? As a brahmin he is no closer to God than when he was a sudra and as a Muslim he had no greater knowledge than as a Hindu."

Mahaprabhuji explained further.

"A true brahmin is one who knows Brahman, the brahma - gyani . It is not by birth that one achieves the social position of brahmin but through the realization of brahma - gyana . All humans belong to one caste only and that is humanity. Therefore it is a great ignorance to classify someone according to higher or lower caste. On the contrary, the position of a person depends on his qualities, actions and abilities. One who makes jewellery from silver and gold is known as a goldsmith, one who makes articles of wood is known as a carpenter and one who works with leather is known as a tanner. In the same way only that one is a brahmin who knows Brahma and only that one who protects living beings is a kshatriya (warrior)."

Wherever Mahaprabhuji held satsang he spoke against the caste system, encouraged the sudras to show more self-confidence and taught the brahmins that the circumstances of another's birth have no bearing on purity or impurity, but that these are only dependent on one's thoughts and deeds.

## [My First Satsang Journey](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1585-my-first-satsang-journey)

After initiation as a swami I felt the urge to go out and hold satsang myself to pass on Mahaprabhuji's teachings but up till then I hadn't done this. Feeling a little depressed and full of jumbled thoughts, I began to think about where I would go, where I would stay, whether I would find any kind of welcome and so on. At this time I was still very young and inexperienced and these things were preying on my mind.

Without revealing a word of my distress, I withdrew to an isolated place where I could think things over without Mahaprabhuji finding me. But of course my state of mind couldn't remain concealed from Mahaprabhuji and at eight o'clock that evening he came to me with a smile.

"Madhavananda, what are you worrying about?"

I could find no words to answer him and so only sat there with lowered head.

"To whom do you belong?" Mahaprabhuji asked. "To whom does this world and the entire universe belong?"

This I managed to answer.

"I belong to you and the whole world and universe are also yours."

"Then why are you afraid?" Mahaprabhuji said. "I will always be with you wherever you may go. Never will you have to worry. Whether you are in the jungle or mountains, in this country or far away, I will always care for you. This is my blessing which will stay with you forever." After giving me this promise, Mahaprabhuji sang the following bhajan :



KARDUN AJAR-AMAR TAN KAYA

I can make you immortal! I can make you immortal! If you are a real devotee of the Lord, why is your mind troubled? Take your example from great Bhaktas like Prahlad, Dhruva, Maharaja Harish Chandra, Narsibhagat, Kabirdas, Mira, The Pandavas.

This bhajan praises the deep faith of the Saints. Mirabai was once presented with a drink of poison and she drank it without hesitation. Through the grace of the Lord it became nectar.

Mahaprabhuji sang this bhajan for me in his splendid voice. I was uplifted and felt happy, more free than ever before. He then gave me some other instructions and advice.

Again I experienced that Mahaprabhuji cared for all who sought shelter in him and liberated them from all worldly sorrows.

The next day at two o'clock in the afternoon I departed for the East, as Mahaprabhuji had instructed. I said goodbye to Gurudeva, thanking him for his grace and, while meditating on him in my heart, I left the Khatu Ashram.

After holding satsang in some villages I came to Sujangarh, where I stayed for a few days. I then went on to Ratangarh and like this, travelled from place to place giving satsang and granting mantra diksha to many. Everywhere I was received with great respect and love.

On this journey I also visited Jamnagar. There I gave satsangs for some days and because I couldn't speak Gujarati, I held my lectures in Hindi. But many of the listeners barely understood Hindi so I prayed to Mahaprabhuji for help and he assured me that within two or three days I would learn Gujarati. And indeed, through his grace, I could give satsang in Gujarati after three days.

When I returned to Khatu Ashram, happy to see Mahaprabhuji again, I told him of my experiences and thanked him for my success.

## [Mauna Satsang](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1587-mauna-satsang)

At brahma muhurta — the morning hours before dawn — the devotees came with gifts and mala s made of flowers to visit Mahaprabhuji. They greeted him and each received prasad , then sat down for satsang . The whole atmosphere was filled with Divine joy as the song of bhajans and kirtan s began.

During his satsangs , Mahaprabhuji would speak on various spiritual subjects and the topics this day was " Mauna Satsang " — a satsang without words. In mauna satsang all participants silently direct their questions and desires to Gurudeva and after some time receive an answer, also in thought form.

All looked at Mahaprabhuji and he gazed them with eyes full of love and kindness, deeply touching their hearts. Then with a gentle smile he raised the index finger of his right hand to touch his lips. Everyone sat in complete peace and silence, immersed in his ocean of nectar.

The Omnipresent filled the depths of each soul with Divine love and after a time the people felt Gurudeva's message deep inside them:

" Atma and paramatma [2] are One. Human dharma is One. Brahman is One. One day all that exists will again dissolve in Brahman. Everything has its origin in this One and will eventually reunite there. The source of All-Being that maintains this universe is only this One. This One is perfect and immortal. There is only one Truth — the different paths which originate from this source will again lead back to it."

After this message each person in the satsang received a special message of his or her own.

The politicians heard Mahaprabhuji's warning: "Don't forget your duty while under the influence of power associated with your job. Honour the king and love all people. The public always follows the example set by the famous. If politicians fulfil their dharma , the people will also."

The rich heard Gurudeva's message as such: "Money isn't everything. Don't allow maya to fool you. Your possessions will stay here when you leave this world. Good karma is the only wealth that will accompany you at the hour of your death. If you serve the poor and others with your money, you also serve God."

The physically strong heard: "To have strength is a gift from God, therefore protect all living beings, don't harm them. Use your strength to defend the Truth. If you don't do this, what is the use of strength?"

Deep within, the yogis felt: "Yoga is the reunion of the individual self with the Divine Self. If you practise yoga with a strong mind your success will be assured."

The Vedic scientists understood Mahaprabhuji like this: "God is the only truth. The world is illusion, unreal, binding you and making you suffer."

The devotees of Gayatri heard: "The Gayatri Mantra is the mahamantra . Gayatri gives you the siddhi to fulfil all wishes in this world and others. But take care to learn the correct technique of Gayatri-service from a Satguru, otherwise success will not come."

The devotees of Shakti received this message from Mahaprabhuji: "The goddess is Mahamaya. She can give you earthly pleasure but not liberation. Liberation is only achieved through the Satguru."

The devotees of a personal God in human form and the devotees of the formless Brahman were told: "I am both sarguna and nirguna . Nothing else exists but me."

The Prarthana Samajis heard: "Prayer is the essence of religion and nourishment for the soul. It helps in the battle against ego, the strongest enemy of the spiritual aspirant."

For the Christians, this was Gurudeva's message: "The message of Jesus Christ is true. The path of service and forgiveness is your deliverance and liberation. Follow his example."

The Sikhs heard within: "Guru Nanak was a Divine incarnation. The ship of his name will carry you across the ocean of this world. Always chant his name."

The Muslims heard: "Allah is God. He alone exists in the many names and forms. He alone lives in the hearts of all beings. Therefore harm no-one, never cause pain to any being and pray to the Lord."

The Parsi received Mahaprabhuji's message in this way: "Honour of fire means honour of all forms. Fire burns everything. Fire by its very nature transforms everything into fire. In the same way, Gurudeva burns the ignorance of the disciple in the fire of self knowledge."

To the Buddhists, Mahaprabhuji spoke: "Keep to the rules of Buddhism and be true followers of Buddha. That is your liberation."

The brahmins heard him say: "Fulfil your duty to Brahman and you will be real brahmins . Only one who knows Brahman is a brahmin ."

The kshatriyas [3] heard Gurudeva: "It is your highest duty to protect all living creatures. To kill innocent people and animals is a violation of dharma . Who so interferes with dharma loses everything."

The vaishyas [4] heard Mahaprabhuji's words: "Realize your duty and serve the people. Don't be greedy and don't harm others out of selfishness. By deceiving others you betray your Self."

The sudras [5] were told: "To serve and to help is the highest dharma , therefore serve everyone with love. But don't think you are less important. You are not beneath others but equal to everyone."

The women heard Mahaprabhuji: "You are the bricks of the wall. You are Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. You gave life to Saints, kings, scientists and brave men. You are the strongest power in the world, as you alone are bearing all living beings."

The students heard him say: "Strive for a good education with devotion and constant effort. Serve the people with your knowledge. Science makes people important in this world, therefore always be prepared to learn more. Only those who have learned something are honoured in this world."

And all of them received the message of Mahaprabhuji's Golden Wisdom:

In this way, everybody received Mahaprabhuji's message according to their own belief and devotion. After some time, Maha­prabhuji removed his finger from his lips.

"The thought that each of you now hold in your mind, is right," he said with a gentle smile. "I am in you and you are in me. Meditate on your Guru , pray and chant his name with devotion. Search for spiritual knowledge and your spiritual goal. Follow the words of the Guru ."



SO HAM

"I am that Truth, Knowledge and Wisdom, the perfect Satguru, the Conscious Brahman, the everlasting Light."

Mahaprabhuji then sang:

SATGURU ESA RAM

The Satguru makes the nectar of wisdom flow, Like God Indra, he makes it rain. He doesn't discriminate between high and low, He treats the king and poor alike, He takes away the three obstacles [6] . Free, without desire or any kind of fear, He rests happy within himself.

He is the liberator, beyond all duality, His grace is unchangeable, He is the creator, the everlasting, the Omnipotent, Even Shiva meditates on him and serves him, He is immovable like the Meru mountain, Perfect and without change, Practising inner and outer renunciation, He is the liberator who destroys the ties of karma For the deliverance of souls, The incarnation of bliss come on earth.

Sri Deep says, I bow my head in deep devotion Before my Gurudeva.



He continued: "In the external universe the sun gives warmth and light to the planets. There is only one sun, visible to everyone, shining for all living creatures. In the same way I, the everlasting, conscious Light, illuminate Wisdom and the perfect Light of Brahman, of the whole creation, inside and out. I shine in all things movable and immovable, in the sun, moon and stars, in Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and the Saints. I shine in the Divine incarnations, in the rishis and all other manifestations of God as the Omnipotent and only power of life.

"I was at the beginning and there was nothing but me. And I will be forever, without another beside me. All this, My ancient Vedas tell."

As Mahaprabhuji spoke, all listened with fixed attention, for in his voice was the power of the unifying Divine Love that touches all hearts. The listeners felt free from earthly worries, cares and fears and experienced the inner joy of the soul. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsi, all treated him in the same way, as their Divine Master.

They would speak of Mahaprabhuji like this: "Mahaprabhuji has explained to us the essence of our religion in such a clear, understandable way, it is as if he himself had established it. He is a remarkable Saint for he only wishes the best for all people regardless of their religion. He is the symbol of goodness, wellbeing and development of humans. He is truly Gurudeva, the Ocean of Nectar. In his presence all pain, doubts and worries disappear."

When the satsang was over, all felt rich with the gift of Divine wisdom and blessing. All hearts were filled with gratitude towards Mahaprabhuji, for it was through his mercy that they had gained clarity, light and inspiration for their religious path.



[1] mauna = observance of silence

[2] atma = individual soul, paramatma = highest or cosmic soul

[3] kshatriya = warrior

[4] vaishya = merchant

[5] sudra = labourer

[6] The three obstacles are the tri-tapas : adi-bodhik = obstacles coming from the material world, adhi-devik = obstacles coming from the astral world, adhi - atmik = obstacles coming from the sphere of the tattvas (elements).

## [Mahaprabhuji's Photograph](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1615-mahaprabhujis-photograph)

During this time in Ajmer, several devotees asked him if they could take a photograph of him, as there were still none available. They made an appointment with a photographer, who set up his camera and took a number of shots.

When the plates were developed there was nothing to be seen but light. The photographer was confused and thought that perhaps something was wrong with his equipment, so he made a careful check that all was in order and tried once more. Again there was only white light, for until he received Divine approval, he wouldn't produce any pictures. On the third attempt he stepped before Mahaprabhuji with folded hands.

"Please, Lord, grant me permission to take a photo of your Divine face so that I may earn my livelihood and your devotees shall have this in memory of you."

"My photo is unimportant," Mahaprabhuji replied. "It is nothing but a piece of paper. My devotees will see me before them whenever they think of me and keep me in their hearts. Carrying this in their minds they will achieve liberation."

But in his grace he finally consented.

"I've told you what's most important," he said, "but if it is still wished so much, I will allow three pictures to be taken."

These photographs were developed and the wonder of the Master was revealed as he appeared in each photo in a different age. In one he appeared as a youth, in one at his present age and in one as an old man!

## [Mahaprabhuji's Mahasamadhi](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1620-mahaprabhujis-mahasamadhi)

In March 1963, while staying in Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, I received a letter from Mahaprabhuji saying that I should come to him as soon as possible and to bring with me cotton cloth for a meditation shawl. I was very happy to have the opportunity to fulfil his wish, as Mahaprabhuji had never asked me for anything. One of my disciples Dr. N. D. Bhatt, asked if he could donate the material for the shawl for Mahaprabhuji and he obtained enough cotton to make a whole robe. Together we then travelled on to Khatu. We arrived at the ashram on the festive day of Holi and with much joy we greeted Mahaprabhuji, who blessed us and thanked us for the gift.

It is here that I would like to include the story of King Hiranakashyap in relation to the well-known Indian festival of Holi.

King Hiranakashyap had practised strict asceticism for a long time and he prayed to be granted a siddhi . One day he succeeded and a Divine voice sounded from heaven.

"What is your desire, O king?"

King Hiranakashyap's greatest longing was like the longing of many people —  he wished for immortality. To the Divine voice he made a carefully worded request.

"It is my wish that death should not touch me, either by day or night, neither in my house nor outside, neither by human nor animal, nor by any weapon."

"Your wish shall be granted," the voice answered.

Thinking that he was now immortal, the king let his arrogance grow without bounds and he did not stop even before God.

"I am God," he maintained. "There is no other God but me!"

He ordered his subjects to worship him as God. Prayers and devotions dedicated to any other God were made punishable by death. To enforce compliance with these instructions, the king himself travelled throughout the land.

On one of these sojourns he met an old woman who was sitting in front of a kiln calling on God's name in her despair.

"How dare you!" the king shouted angrily at her. "This name is of no use to you. Only I can give you what you want, for I am God and there exists no other God but me!"

Trembling with fear, the old woman told him her story.

"Take pity on me, O Lord, and hear me out before I am sentenced. I made some earthen pots and wished to fire them in the kiln, but before putting them in the kiln I left them to dry. In the meantime a cat crept inside one and gave birth to four young. By an unfortunate mistake I also placed that pot in the fire and now I plead to God either to rescue the lives of the cats or relieve me from the guilt of their death."

"Now it shall be proven what your prayer can do," King Hiranakashyap said with a scornful smile. "I shall wait until your pots are ready and if the cats are not alive, you will also die through fire!"

All night the poor woman desperately prayed for God's help. In the afternoon of the next day when the fire had burnt out, she began to clear away the ashes with trembling hands. And what did she see? In four of the jugs was soft green grass and in it the cats were playing, jumping from one pot to the other!

"Praise be to God!" the woman shouted gratefully and without a word the king mounted his horse and rode off.

King Hiranakashyap had a highly spiritually developed son called Prahlad, who even as a small child, prayed to God and of this his father greatly disapproved. Again and again the king would punish Prahlad for his prayers, but the boy couldn't be dissuaded from repeating the name of God, regardless of his father's threats or mistreatment. This infuriated the king so much that on several occasions he even tried to kill his son.

Once he ordered that the boy be thrown into the sea at a place known to have many sharks. The king also abandoned him in the jungle, surrounded by a herd of wild elephants. He even pushed his son off high rocks but each time Prahlad was mysteriously saved and returned home unhurt.

The king had a sister named Holika who possessed the exceptional siddhi of remaining unscathed by fire. One day the king ordered her to take the child and sit in the middle of a burning pile of wood, but another miracle happened: the king's sister was burnt to ashes but the child remained unscathed.

In a further effort to be rid of his son, the king erected an iron column in the courtyard of his palace and in its hollow frame lit a fire until the column glowed red with intense heat. Before sunset the king called his son to him.

"If you maintain that God is everywhere, then go there and embrace God in the form of this column."

Prahlad had complete trust in God the Omnipotent and knew that if it was His wish, he would survive. Bravely he walked towards the red-hot column and, on nearing it, realized to his surprise that the red colour was not due to the heat, but was from millions of little red ants that ran up and down it.

"These little ants won't harm me," he thought and so gladly stretched out his arms to embrace the column.

But in this moment the iron column split open and an enormous creature emerged. Its head and trunk were like that of a lion and from the navel to its feet it was of human form.

The creature embraced the child.

"My son, you have suffered enough!"

Thereupon it turned to the frightened king, who was trying to escape. The creature pursued the king and captured him exactly at the threshold of the palace door. The king was flung to the ground and pinned there.

"Tell me, are you inside or outside your home?" roared the creature in a thunderous voice.

Trembling, the king replied, "Neither, nor."

"Is it day or night?" the creature demanded.

"Neither, nor," the king again replied, for the sun was equally above and below the horizon.

"Am I animal or man?" continued the creature.

"You are neither!" the king shouted in panic.

The lion-creature, the Godhead Nar-Singh, showed his terrible claws and questioned, "Are these weapons?"

The king had to admit that they were not.

"So, by your wish all your conditions have been met and now the hour of your death has come," the creature bellowed and with that, Nar-Singh tore the wicked king to pieces.

The boy Prahlad became a great hero and a king who ruled his subjects with wisdom and devotion.

It is on the festival of Holi in India that all are reminded of the king's sister, Holika. At the end of February, two trees are placed in the centre of the village. The bigger one is to symbolise Holika and the smaller one Prahlad. For one month the villagers celebrate with dance and song and at the end of the month, on the day of the full moon, the tree of Holika is set alight. Sweets are distributed and it is custom to paint oneself and others with bright colours to express joy of the victory of good over evil.

Now let us return again to the events of Khatu in the year of 1963.

At an early hour on the morning after our arrival, Mahaprabhuji called me to his room and spoke the words I have already quoted in the preface of this book, revealing that he would leave the world ten months hence, on the day of Pausha Krishna Chaturti, December 5, 1963, at five o'clock in the morning.

As I was unwilling to believe this announcement, he urged, "Tell me, what is your greatest wish so that later on you may not regret having missed this opportunity."

Eventually I said a prayer and then spoke, "Holy Master, I ask just for one thing, that my concentration be directed only to you at any place, at any time. That all your devotees be blessed and led in your omnipotence to achieve brahmananda (Divine bliss). I wish for millions of people to live by your blessing so that the world's suffering will be relieved."

Mahaprabhuji laid his hand upon my head in blessing.

"My son, the light of my true form shall always be with you. Anywhere, at any time, you are protected by me. Whatever you wish will be fulfilled."

I then repeated my already often expressed request to be permitted to write his life story and this time he agreed. I was immensely happy about this but, on the other hand, was deeply worried and confused by the announcement of his impending departure from this world.

Mahaprabhuji knew the state of my mind.

"Whenever there are devotees who concentrate on me, I will be there, ready to help them. You don't believe what I am telling you today, but you know that I always speak the truth. Prepare yourself, for I will leave this body just as I have said."

When I left him I was very sad and still could not truly convince myself that what he said would actually come to pass. I said goodbye to him and now, when I think back on his words, I deeply regret not having paid heed to them.

Even two years before his departure he had told some disciples in order to prepare them, but none wanted to believe it. In my thoughts I always had in mind that I would leave this world before Mahaprabhuji, or at least at the same time and in this way I'd be spared the pain of living without him. However, destiny often determines things differently to what we would like.

Dr. Bhatt and I returned to Ahmedabad and during the next months I was very busy. I accepted an invitation to go to a palace which had been offered for my use. This palace was in the Pali district, high on a hill near Rani and it belonged to the former minister of the Maharaja, Dharma Narayan. There we celebrated many wonderful satsangs .

Six months later, Mahaprabhuji again reminded us of his impending departure and two months before the predicted date, he announced the place where his monument of samadhi should be built. Numerous people gathered at the ashram in Khatu, where every day now Mahaprabhuji held satsang .

One of his close disciples, an Ayurvedic doctor named Vaidya Asha Ram, did not believe Mahaprabhuji would leave the world so soon. Vaidya Asha Ram said that Gurudeva looked much too healthy and happy to die, so therefore on December 4 th he requested Mahaprabhuji that he be allowed to return home to continue his work.

"Asha Ram, tomorrow I will leave here. Stay until then," Mahaprabhuji said to him.

However, still Asha Ram and many other disciples didn't believe him and thought that Gurudeva was just playing one of his Divine Lilas, so they left the ashram . This is something they still regret.

In these days Mahaprabhuji was like a victorious king. Light surrounded him and he looked vibrant and young, although he was 135 years of age.

In my room in Rani, at four o'clock on the morning of December 5, 1963, I had a vision of Mahaprabhuji during my meditation in which he placed his hand on my head.

"Today I go to satya loka [1] ,” he said with a smile. “Look, four messengers have come to accompany me. They stand behind you."

When I looked around I saw four devas with the appearance of Lord Vishnu, bowing reverently with folded hands before Mahaprabhuji.

"Lord of the Universe, a great celebration is in preparation for your welcome. Everyone expects to see you and you are requested to set off without delay."

I was surprised to see Lord Vishnu in four persons at the same time and Mahaprabhuji then explained.

"These are not Vishnu himself, but only his messengers. In vishnu loka all inhabitants live like Lord Vishnu, in shiva loka like Lord Shiva, in brahma loka like Lord Brahma, in indra loka like Lord Indra and in deva loka like devas. The inhabi­tants of each level are like their Master."

An ornate throne, glittering like the Sun, decorated with sparkling pearls and gems, floated down towards Mahaprabhuji and he ascended ready to return to his divine home. Like a heavenly vehicle, the throne carried Mahaprabhuji together with the four messengers quickly through space,

The gandharvas (angels) praised Gurudeva with songs as he passed through their astral level. In deva loka (realm of the gods) he was welcomed by celestial dances and songs. In indra loka (heaven) Indra, the Lord of Gods, Dharma Raj (the king of dharma ) and many others showered Mahaprabhuji with gifts.

His welcome in vishnu loka was splendid and Goddess Lakshmi Herself decorated Mahaprabhuji with the flower- mala . In shiva loka the welcome was different. Shiva performed the tandava dance [2] in his honour.

Thus Mahaprabhuji came to satya loka , which was brightly lit as if by a thousand Suns, although there shines neither Sun or Moon. Satya loka is filled with everlasting bliss — ananda . There exists no duality, like heat and cold, pain and joy, brightness and darkness. Only a single sound fills the whole space:

Om Satya Brahma Sri Deep Narayan Pari Puran Namaha

This sound also resonates on all other levels.

In my meditation I was outside my physical consciousness and was witness to all these scenes. However, in one moment the visions disappeared and again I was back in my normal state of awareness. The whole day I thought of this vision.

On Wednesday, December 5th, 1963, a morning satsang was held as usual in the Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram and Mahaprabhuji gave prasad to everyone.

Ten minutes before five o'clock he spoke to those present.

"My dears, in case you still have any wishes, tell me now for soon I will say goodbye to you."

For some moments there was silence. Then came the only question from all present.

"Master! Are you leaving us alone here?"

Mahaprabhuji's words blessed them.

"Don't be afraid! You are with me always and I am with you. Whenever my devotees think of me I will be present, no matter what country, what place, what year it is.

"My soul is indestructible and immortal. Only the physical body is mortal, since it is made of the five elements. This is an unchangeable, natural law but you should know that I am always with you. Those devotees who are unable to be here with me today will also see me once more and I shall grant them their desires.

"Difficult times are approaching and the world will be influenced by destructive powers and disbelief. But you shall remain steadfast and never lose your path! Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto truth and always remember God."

After these words of farewell, at exactly five o'clock in the morning, Mahaprabhuji began to chant OM. Prana and apana united and rose towards brahma ran­­dhra [3] .

Those present clearly heard the manifestation OM rise in Mahaprabhuji's body and then pass through the sahasrar chakra . His heart stopped beating and his body began to grow cold, but his face still radiated the Divine glow of his gentle smile. Such a samadhi is only possible with God-realized yogis .

The science of yoga is a valuable gift to humanity that goes far beyond the physical nature of things.

As Mahaprabhuji had promised, on the day of his samadhi he appeared to all those devotees who had been unable to come to Khatu.

Mahaprabhuji's body was buried some days later because hundreds of devotees wished to say their final farewell to his holy form. The body remained soft and natural-looking. Finally it was laid to rest according to tradition in the place previously chosen by Mahaprabhuji. Many yogis and swamis took part in this ceremony and for two weeks the faithful, who had gathered in crowds from all parts of India, chanted songs and prayer in his honour.

The magnificent monument of Mahaprabhuji, covered by a baldachin of marble, is located in the meditation hall of Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram at Khatu. Thousands of followers come to this holy place to receive his blessing and see where Mahaprabhuji lived and worked.



[1] satya loka = highest level of truth and reality ( satya = truth, loka = level)

[2] tandava dance = dance of Shiva as the destroyer of evil

[3] brahma randhra = "door of Brahman" another name for the sahasrar chakra , the thousand-petalled lotus, the seat of Divine Consciousness, the door of liberation. In a normal person the prana (vital energy) leaves the body at the moment of death through one of the nine "doors" (i.e., eyes, nose, mouth, ears, etc.). However, the soul of a realized yogi departs through the tenth door of liberation, the Divine door, which is located at the top of the head.

## [God Appears in Many Forms](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1618-god-appears-in-many-forms)

Whenever the disciples of Mahaprabhuji came together we spoke about our good fortune in meeting him in this life and shared the experiences of the grace that he bestowed on each of us in different ways. Mahaprabhuji filled the innermost needs of every devotee through that aspect of God whom they worshipped.

Once a follower of Sai Nath [1] had intended to go and see his Master, who was far away. On seeing Mahaprabhuji before him, he recoiled in surprise.

"Lord, how did you come to be in Rajasthan? How is it possible?"

He prostrated himself at the feet of Mahaprabhuji and on standing up, again recognised his own teacher.

"I am everywhere," Mahaprabhuji said. "Wherever you are, I am with you. Sai Nath, Mahaprabhuji, Rama, Krishna, all are one. The atma is one and eternal."

The following event makes this quite clear.

During a journey through the district of Mewar I came to the village of Gangapur, where a sadhu lived in a small temple near the cemetery.

He was a strict ascetic dedicated to Lord Shiva. He never left the temple, he ate very little and repeated his mantra day and night.

"Despite your efforts you won't gain anything in this way," I said to him and I recommended the following: "Proceed under the protection of a realized Master whose Self is one with Shiva and follow him and his teachings. Only thus will you reach your aim."

"In kali yuga there are no such Guru s," the sadhu snapped.

"Come with me," I invited him, "and see if my Divine Master can meet your expectations."

Together we travelled to Khatu and when the sadhu saw Mahaprabhuji, he was filled with reverence and joy.

"Lord Shiva! What a miracle! I was looking for you where I lived, but all the time you were here!"

Mahaprabhuji blessed him.

"Today your time of asceticism is over. You have reached your goal. From now on I will always be with you whenever you think of me."



[1] Sai Nath , also known as Sai Baba , a well-known Indian Saint.

## [Vedanta Conference](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1616-vedanta-conference)

I was staying in the Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram when Mahaprabhuji received an invitation to go to Bombay to speak at a conference on the Vedas and Vedanta . Mahaprabhuji appointed me to take part in this meeting on his behalf and when I insisted that he should go, told me that for the time being he didn't wish to make any journeys.

So I went to Bombay to take part in the conference where many scholars, swamis , yogis and mahamandaleshwaras were present. Lectures were given on various subjects. My own was about Mahaprabhuji himself and it was listened to with much interest.

One of the participants, Mahatma Vishuddhananda, asked me the secret of my ability to impress the listeners with my words. He wanted to know if Mahaprabhuji had granted me a special mantra , magic or other secret power. He also asked some curious questions regarding my income.

Since I had nothing to hide, I answered with a bhajan in which I testified that my only capital was my Satguru, Sri Mahaprabhuji, the Highest Brahman, who had given me the wealth of the whole universe. I also said that I had gained neither an academic degree nor practised any rigorous asceticism. Never had I anything to do with magic, Tantra, the worship of goddesses, gods or spirits, but had always sought shelter in Mahaprabhuji. The secret of my great luck lay only in the light and blessing of my Guru . The grace of my Guru was my only title, my qualification and my whole capital.

## [Mahaprabhuji Saves the Harvest of Kana Ram](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1592-mahaprabhuji-saves-the-harvest-of-kana-ram)

Once when Mahaprabhuji was giving satsang in Khatu village at the time of the monsoon, a farmer called Kana Ram rose to his feet and came to bid goodbye to Mahaprabhuji. I was also present at this satsang .

"Kana Ram, what must you do at this hour of the day?" Mahaprabhuji asked.

"Mahaprabhuji, a swarm of locusts has reached the mountains of Khatu and endangers the crops. My field is the first in their path so I want to burn a large fire that will kill them."

"I assure you that locusts won't enter your field and damage your crop," Mahaprabhuji said. "You shouldn't burn innocent creatures."

The next day when the swarm of locusts neared the field, a great wonder occurred. From out of nowhere flew a large flock of crows and perched in the field. The locusts couldn't enter. Kana Ram himself was witness to this and began to preach the almighty power and mercy of Mahaprabhuji.

The maya of Gurudeva is unique. He had called upon the birds to protect the fields in this wonderful way. Only Divine souls can perform such miracles.

## [Meetings with Mahashakti](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1588-meetings-with-mahashakti)

It was four o'clock in the afternoon and as usual Mahaprabhuji was holding satsang when suddenly there stepped before him a very old woman whom I thought to be at least hundred years old. She was dressed like a man and wore a foot anklet of silver.

To the surprise of all, she paid her respects to Mahaprabhuji in the traditional manner, circling him seven times, then kneeling on the earth and reverently bowing before him twenty-one times. None of us had ever seen her before. All were wondering who she could be. Physically she looked thin and frail but obviously she possessed much mental vigour as she was certainly radiant.

She spoke to Mahaprabhuji in a foreign dialect and we could understand only fragments of their conversation, but Mahaprabhuji obviously knew her because he greeted her warmly.

"Be welcome, Mataji (mother)! After such a long time, at last you have found your way here."

"Only your grace has led me here," she replied.

After that I was unable to distinguish any more and so I asked Mahaprabhuji if I could go and collect wood for the fire.

As I stood up, the old woman indicated that she wanted to come with me.

"Mother, I am afraid you won't be able to keep pace with me. I must hurry to be back in time for prayer."

"We'll see," she merely said and followed me out of the ashram .

How surprised I was! Contrary to my belief, it was I who couldn't keep pace with her and I was soon left behind! Even running I couldn't catch her. She seemed to know exactly where I wanted to go because she headed in that direction and stopped to wait for me at exactly the place I had in mind.

Breathless, I finally reached the place where she stood smiling at me.

"You see, in spite of your youth you were unable to keep up with me."

Needless to say I was baffled by her physical prowess and now, more than ever, was eager to know who she was. I collected the firewood and we returned to the ashram .

That evening, after satsang and prayer, Mataji went into the courtyard and spread out her blanket near the well. There she sat down and sank into deep meditation. All night long she sat motionless in meditative posture and every now and then I could hear her sing OM and Mahaprabhuji's name. On this night I was serving Mahaprabhuji and took the opportunity to ask him about our mysterious guest.

"She is Mahashakti Mateshwari, the eternal Divine Shakti and Mother. If she wishes, she can dislodge whole mountains with her little finger."

At four o'clock in the morning Mahaprabhuji gave me instructions to spread a red blanket beside his bed and light oil lamps and incense sticks.

"In a few minutes the Divine Mother will appear in this room."

Just when I wanted to ask if I should open the door, the whole room filled with red light and in this light appeared the Divine Mother in the radiant form of Goddess Tripura Sundari, the goddess of eternal youth and beauty. She bowed before Mahaprabhuji, then settled beside his bed.

"Be welcome, Divine Mother," Mahaprabhuji greeted her. "You are Omnipresent, eternal Divine shakti . The whole cosmos is your creation. You represent the three gunas and the five elements, the force of kundalini and the chakras . You can bring down the most excellent one, when through your maya , pride and ego have awakened in him. Through you a king can become beggar and beggar a king. You are wor­shipped by countless names — Gayatri, Sarasvati, Sati, Sita, Radha, Lakshmi, Brahmani, Amba, Ashapura, Nava Durga, Chamunda, Kali, Minakshi, Dakini, Shakini, Vishwa Mohini, Bhuvaneshvari, Bageshvari and many more. The animal you ride is the mighty tiger [1] . Your lila is infinite and unfathomable, indescribable and limitless. None can com­prehend you in your abundance. O Mateshwari, Divine Mother, tell me, what can I do for you?"

Mateshwari smiled, bowed her head and spoke to Mahaprabhuji:

"You are Vishwa Deep, the Lord of all worlds. Through you, in all three times — past, present and future — the Light of Wisdom is conveyed to humans. You alone live in the hearts of all beings. Without your Divine Light, ignorance cannot be overcome and as you have said in one bhajan :

Even though an object may lie directly in front of me, It remains invisible as long as there is no light to fall upon it. In the same way, realization of Truth is impossible Without the enlightenment of the Satguru.

"You are right," she continued. "All that maya is able to provide, I can give as a gift to humans: riddhis , siddhis , wealth and power. I can create and destroy, but O Lord, maya only binds and that is the immutable law which I obey. I am unable to give liberation to my devotees. Only by the grace of the Satguru can they attain liberation, unalterable bliss, happiness and eternal peace.

Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Rama, Krishna and other Divine incarnations, all the venerable gods and goddesses, should be worshipped for that reason, because they serve the Satguru and meditate on him all the time.

Maharani Mira, the incarnation of Radha, sang in a bhajan :

Forever more my thoughts remain with my Guru, Nothing in the world can entice me, it is only an illusion, a dream, For me the ocean of the world has dried, without effort I can cross it, Mira says, Through the grace of my Guru I am Liberated From all harm, from death and birth.

In another bhajan , Mira has said,

My Guru has presented me With the most valuable jewel: The name of God, Its worth is priceless and increases every day.

O Lord of mercy !  Following the command of Paramatma to the saints, rishis, yogis and other great incarnations, I give siddhis and rich blessing according to the intensity of their worship and practice. Yet I do not obey them, but obey the will of the Supreme. Just as the light of the torch cannot compete with the brilliance of the Sun, saints, mahatmas , rishis and munis are unable to compare with Vishwa Deep.

You are Brahman, the eternal, unalterable, indestructible. You are the origin and goal of all living beings. Without the grace of the Guru , you cannot be realized. Through the power of maya , you manifest. The infinite play of the universe is my work. But you alone are the Life and Consciousness in it. I do not exist without you — Brahman and maya are One. Only a few are able to understand this secret.

Just as the bird may only fly with two wings, so only a true devotee may achieve peace and liberation if he reveres Mahamaya and Gurudeva, the Highest Self.

In the age of kali yuga , living beings suffer sorrow and pain as they are victim to their illusions and mistakes. Injustice, lies and fraud rule the world. To rescue your devotees and libe­rate those who have lost their way, you have again appeared on this earth. I beg you, be gracious to all who worship and seek shelter in you with pure heart. By your grace, grant them a happy life. Warn them of harm and sorrows, until finally they may attain liberation in Unity with you."

This conversation went on for about an hour and only Mahaprabhuji, Mateshwari and I were present. As soon as the other disciples came in to greet Mahaprabhuji, the Divine Mother, Mataji, again took the appearance of an old woman.

Before Mahaprabhuji began his satsang , she turned to all who had gathered.

"You ignorant ones!" she spoke. "Before you, you see God Himself and yet you are incapable of recognising him. You only come here to satisfy your worldly desires."

She then bowed before Mahaprabhuji and took her leave. After walking some metres she disappeared like the flame of a candle, simply blown out.

## [The Devotion of a Tiger](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1606-the-devotion-of-a-tiger)

Mahaprabhuji was to spend some days in Guru Sikar near Mount Abu and I accompanied him there with some disciples. Early in the morning we departed from Guru Sikar to go to Achaleshwar Mahadeva. The way led through hilly and densely wooded areas in which wild animals lived and the disciples became anxious and afraid when we saw some bears in the distance. Mahaprabhuji reassured us and said we should move on without fear.

In a particularly dense part of the forest Mahaprabhuji stopped.

"Here we shall take a rest. You will sit under this tree and I will go over there and meditate. Should some wild animal come, remain totally calm and don't be afraid."

Mahaprabhuji settled himself under an ashoka tree and we sat where he had instructed us. After a short time we could hear the spitting of a tiger. It was obviously quite close and we became nervous. Mahaprabhuji remained absorbed in meditation. Suddenly a mighty tiger broke from the bushes and ran directly towards Mahaprabhuji. Frightened almost to death, we quickly climbed the tree under which we had been sitting and watched as the tiger stopped a short distance in front of Mahaprabhuji.

Mahaprabhuji, totally calm, only looked at the tiger. The tiger bowed its head before him and after this disappeared into the jungle.

We observed this scene in total amazement and then Mahaprabhuji called us to him with a smile.

"Why were you afraid?" he asked. "I've told you that you needn't be frightened, for whoever is under the grace of the Guru shall not be harmed by any living being.

"I wanted to show you the inadequacy and weakness of fear when opposed to the unerring power of love. If I had been as anxious as you, the tiger would have attacked me instantly. Fear is a sign of helplessness. You are mistaken if you think you were helpless. The opposite of fear is love. Let love and positive feelings flow freely in you and fear and negative thoughts will disappear. Your love ought to be so strong that you can communicate it to others. Even wild animals will not harm you when they sense your love."

We felt we had learned something important and were witnesses to the wonderful power of love. This event should serve as a parable for us. The point is not to hug real lions and tigers, but to face the wild animals of the subconscious: our fears, complexes, aggressions and negative feelings. Quietly observe these without fear and dissolve them with love. You will then experience that they are no longer so threatening and agonising. As if by miracle you will meet love and understanding and this will come into the outer world as well.

## [The Mute Recovers His Voice](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1593-the-mute-recovers-his-voice)

A merchant family from the Punjab had come to the ashram to visit Mahaprabhuji and the head of this family stepped before him with folded hands in greeting.

"O Lord of Mercy, ten contracts of marriage have been made within our family. Of all these only one child has been born and unfortunately this boy is mute. We have tried our best and sought all treatments but without success. We heard of your holy name and glory and that from your gracious glance devotees are released from their distress. Kindly allow us to take shelter in you. We hope that in your graciousness you will remove our pain."

Mahaprabhuji looked at them with his gentle smile.

"You need not worry. Everything can be achieved through devotion."

Then he called for a piece of red chalk and with it wrote a sign upon the dumb boy's tongue. Voice was granted to the child and he began to sing OM. The parents and family were overjoyed and they thanked Mahaprabhuji from the depths of their hearts.

Mahaprabhuji also accurately foretold that the boy would become a successful businessman.

## [The Liberation of a Snake](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1589-the-liberation-of-a-snake)

During one satsang that Mahaprabhuji was holding at the Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram, he smiled to himself and suddenly changed the subject of his talk.

"Now the moment has come in which the heavy karma of this being shall be over. It shall be released!"

None present knew what he was talking about, but their questions were soon answered as Mahaprabhuji pointed with his hand in the direction of the hills.

"A very old snake has its home in these mountains and is just now leaving its cave to come here. Soon it shall arrive and I will free it."

"Mahaprabhuji, if you allow, I will 'free' it with my stick !" said one disciple.

"I don't wish to kill this snake," Mahaprabhuji replied. "I wish to give freedom to the soul imprisoned in its body, for now has finally come the hour of its deliverance."

As they continued to converse, there could suddenly be heard a hoarse sound like that of a water buffalo. The old snake appeared and all around sprang to their feet, as the two-metre-long reptile made its way over the sand. Some tried in vain to push it back with sticks as it advanced towards Mahaprabhuji, however the snake stopped before him and raised its hood and in an almost human way, looked up at him.

Mahaprabhuji made the sign of blessing above its head.

"Your karma is now complete and you shall be released."

He sang OM three times and sprinkled a little water over the snake. As soon as the drops of water fell onto the creature, a resonating sound issued forth which sounded like OM and the soul of the snake left its mortal covering.

Mahaprabhuji gave instructions for the snake to be buried with the same ceremonies due to a human being and then, to satisfy the curiosity of his disciples, he explained.

"The soul which dwelt in the body of this snake was a human in its past life. He lived as a disciple with his Guru but unfortunately his nature was dominated by the rajas guna — aggression and strong emotions. Once, in a sudden rage, he assaulted his Master and was thus condemned for his actions, not by the Master but by the laws of karma . Because of this deed he was reincarnated in the form of a snake and for one hundred years had to endure the consequences of this karma in such a low form of life. Today came the time of his liberation, so now he has been freed.

"May this serve as a lesson to you. Learn self-control and never allow yourself to be carried away in fury with thoughtless deeds and words! Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto Truth and always remember God."

## [The Pearls of the Mala](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1598-the-pearls-of-the-mala)

One January day I was sitting in my room at Shivbagh Ashram in Bola Guda when Mahaprabhuji called me.

"Madhavananda, do you need a mala ?"

"Lord," I replied, "just now I was thinking of how to obtain a mala !"

As I spoke, Mahaprabhuji stretched out his hand.

"Take this mala and use it frequently."

I asked myself from where this mala could suddenly have appeared, because I knew for certain that Mahaprabhuji didn't have any mala s with him. I decided not to dwell on it though and counted my blessings, for I had received a mala from the Lord.

That evening I went to Mahaprabhuji.

"Mahaprabhuji, some make fun at the use of the mala . They say it's useless to thread the pearls with the fingers, while the mind wanders to worldly thoughts. In their opinion, it's better to put the mala aside and turn over the pearls of thoughts."

With a smile, he explained.

"Madhavananda, they are wrong. It is true that your thoughts may wander, but in spite of this let the pearls of the mala glide through your fingers.

"Take the example of the tailor. You give him fabric to make a garment and while he sews, his thoughts wander here and there but his needle does not and very soon, despite his wandering thoughts, the garment is finished. It is the same with the mala . Your thoughts may safely wander, for if you continually move the pearls, you will certainly reach your goal.

"This practice produces abundant fruit and frees one from many karmas . One who always practises with the mala achieves either heaven or liberation. If liberation does not come to him in this life, he will be reborn into a happy and spiritual family where he may continue on his spiritual path. He will live well-respected and in prosperity, so great is the effect of the mala . Therefore, never fail to practise your mantra with the mala !"

"Master," I then asked him, "while moving the pearls we try to keep only positive thoughts in mind but often these are displaced by negative thoughts and no matter how we try to banish such from our mind, they return all too easily. Why is this so?"

"This, Madhavananda, is God's maya . People also make effort to hold possessions and wealth in safe places, yet these flow through one's fingers like water out of a hollow palm. Dirt and dust, on the other hand, always accumulates although we try hard to remove it. Continuous and honest effort is required to keep what is good. Discipline is a true friend of seekers, laziness is the worst enemy. There are two kinds of effort, one for good and the other for bad. Theft, fraud and similar things are examples of harmful actions and therefore are to be avoided. Those people whom the world perceives as great, have achieved their greatness through hard work and effort directed towards good. In this world all can be achieved through effort, but laziness inevitably leads to failure."



[1] The Indian prayer chain is called a " mala ." It has 108 pearls or seeds on a loop of string.

## [My Sannyas Diksha](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1584-my-sannyas-diksha)

My initiation as a swami took place on the day of Chaitra Shukla Purnima in the year 1942 (1999 according to the Indian calendar). On this occasion, Mahaprabhuji organised a large satsang to which he invited many swamis , yogis , pandits and devotees. In his generous way, Thakur Revat Singhji took care to accommodate all the guests.

In the early morning the fire ceremony ( havana ) began and Mahaprabhuji had given me instructions.

"Madhavananda, put on your festive dress of Vishwapati (Lord of the universe), for in these garments even kings will bow before you. May you be Liberated from the influence of the stars, from birth and death."

I had the traditional seven baths ( sapt bhumika ), which signify the purification of the seven states of consciousness [2] and after that Mahaprabhuji gave me a new mantra and performed the paramhansa sannyas diksha [3] . During this most high and honoured ceremony, the aspirant, guided by the Divine Master, instantly attains samadhi [4] .

Mahaprabhuji laid his holy hands upon my head and blessed me and explained the sacred duties of a sannyasi who has renounced the world.

"A sannyasi must weed out all impure qualities from the roots and rid himself forever of desire. Constantly filled with the Light of Truth, he ought to pass this on to all. The highest duty of a sannyasi is to remain attached to nothing and to live and work for the good of the entire universe.

"The sannyasi must show the path of Truth through realization to those who still wander about in the jungle of the world. He ought to serve without prejudice or discrimination between race, position or religion. The atma is in every consciousness, the same in all living beings. The duty of the sannyasi is to lighten the burden of people, not to become a burden for them. To serve me in truth means to serve all. Madhavananda, constantly remember these precepts and never swerve from the Truth!"

I took these words deep into my heart and with folded hands I prayed:



OM NAMO PRABHU DEEP DAYALAM PARAM KRIPALAM

OM, I bow before Prabhu Deep Dayal, The kind preserver and protector of his devotees, The radiance of Vishwa Deep pervades the whole universe.

You know the longing of my mind, My Beloved God, may you live in my heart, Remove the darkness and spread the Light.

I, Madhavananda, bow before you, Whose immense grace has been bestowed upon me, To receive the most precious jewel of your name.

You defeat all evil, You create the world and make it go 'round, Protect me and my every breath.

Mahaprabhuji then said to me, "Madhavananda, with this I have placed into your hands the keys of the kingdom. Now it is up to you to guard them. Onto your tongue I have poured the gold of truth. It now lies with you to prove yourself worthy."



[1] sannyas diksha = initiation ceremony of a swami

[2] This initiation symbolises the seven steps of consciousness that the initiate has to pass. The first six steps are good wishes, good thoughts, control over the body and mind, selflessness, realization of the Truth, non-dualism or realization of immortality. These the initiate must reach through inner purification, selfless service and spiritual sadhana (practices). Through the grace of the Guru (s)he finally achieves the seventh state, turiya — liberation and unity with God.

[3] paramhansa sannyas diksha = initiation to paramhansa, highest spiritual initiation

[4] In this ceremony the Guru bestows the experience of highest consciousness on the initiated swami , which henceforth (s)he should attain by spiritual work.

## [My Selfish Desire](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1602-my-selfish-desire)

On the morning of August 5 th , I said to Mahaprabhuji, "Today I would like to visit Sri Man Singh, the foreman of the local prison."

"Go if you like," Gurudeva answered.

Sri Man Singh was delighted to see me. After our satsang he invited me for a meal and I thanked him for his kind invitation.

"I shall come if you make chapatis from millet flour for me," I replied. These were one of my favourite foods.

"I have no millet flour in my house but I will get some for you. In any case, you must eat at my home!"

He dashed out of the house and returned one hour later with the millet flour and began to prepare the chapatis for me. I enjoyed the meal very much.

Later on I returned to Mahaprabhuji at the palace but soon after I felt some terrible pains in my stomach. Mahaprabhuji noticed my suffering and inquired what was wrong. I replied that I had cramps in the stomach. He asked what I had eaten for lunch.

"Today I ate fresh chapatis from millet flour," I said.

One is not able to hide anything from Mahaprabhuji as he knows all, even before he is told. He instantly gave me the following lecture.

"It was wrong of you to demand that bread. In doing this you violated the law of sannyas , which commands that no selfish request is to be made of the disciples or students. Behind your wish was desire, of which this pain is the result. Swamis ought to eat only that which is offered to them by the host. You may have been unaware of the inconvenience caused to Sri Man Singh in obtaining the millet flour, but in any case punishment has instantly followed."

Recognising my fault, I begged the pardon of Mahaprabhuji.

"I now realize my mistake. Please have compassion on me!"

"At exactly the time you ate the chapatis, the pain will be over. What time did you eat them?"

I answered that it was around eleven o'clock.

"Then your stomach pains will be gone by tomorrow at eleven o'clock."

He added, "Nothing belongs to you. Hold onto truth and remember God."

I had no choice but to further endure the consequencesof my selfish wish but in Mahaprabhuji's presence my attention was so much directed towards him that I almost forgot my pain. So the hours passed quickly and as Mahaprabhuji had foretold, I was feeling perfectly well again twenty-four hours later.

## [A Bear As My Teacher](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1603-a-bear-as-my-teacher)

On the 15th of May, 1954, I was staying with Mahaprabhuji in the Shivbagh Ashram at Bola Guda. Mahaprabhuji had just scolded me and even though it was for my own good, in my ignorance I was still upset and angry. To hide this I silently withdrew into my room though I knew no-one can hide anything from Mahaprabhuji.

Some time later the trainer of a bear came into the ashram to show Mahaprabhuji the tricks of his bear.

At first Mahaprabhuji refused.

"We are sadhus and are not interested in such plays."

"Gurudeva, I have come to you full of hope," the poor man pleaded. "Please do not disappoint me."

Mahaprabhuji relented.

"Well, show your bear to Madhavananda."

He then called me and I tried to refuse.

"Be seated and watch," Mahaprabhuji ordered.

This I had to obey, so I sat and watched as the owner of the bear began the performance. He had the bear imitate the crawling movements of a thief and then those of a dancing fiancee. For a whole hour he had the bear perform many tricks and he did his best to entertain us.

The man and the bear left the ashram after we gave a sum for his show. When all was over, I rose up from my place to return to my room, but Mahaprabhuji held me back.

"Tell me what you've seen," he said.

"You also saw the performance, so what should I tell you?" I answered, irritated.

Mahaprabhuji instructed me to be seated again.

"Now, listen well. A bear is a wild and dangerous animal and the trainer is his Guru . He taught the bear these skills through severe training and without a doubt, by punishing it from time to time. Only the Guru can bring to light the abilities of a disciple. Sometimes the Guru admonishes, chides and acts in harsh ways, but all this is done only in the best interests of the disciple. For this reason, never feel anger towards the Guru .

"A horse can't win a prize if it hasn't been rigorously trained. Gold, silver or iron will only fetch the highest price if first heated in the fire and then worked with the hammer. The highest price for wood is obtained when first it is cut and made into furniture. Clay is first given shape by the potter and baked in the fire of the kiln. Pots made in this way keep the water cool and so give pleasure to all who drink from them. In just this way the Guru moulds the disciple into a perfect vessel into which can be poured the nectar of knowledge. The methods to accomplish this miracle are only known to the Satguru."

I was so impressed with Mahaprabhuji's short lecture that all my negative thoughts passed away and I begged forgiveness from him. Mahaprabhuji laid his hand in blessing on my head and I sank down in supreme happiness.

## [Mahaprabhuji Heals Me](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1600-mahaprabhuji-heals-me)

Several times Mahaprabhuji cured me of serious ailments.

One night after a satsang I had held in the village of Khatu, I suddenly felt quite ill and fainted from unbearable pain. Immediately everyone took great care of me but without success and it became apparent that my life was in danger.

The next morning Mahaprabhuji was informed of my condition, that I was near to death, but with his usual gentle smile he calmed the concerned devotees.

"Don't worry, he'll get better. Without my permission death has no power over him. Twice already death has tried to take Madhavananda but had to relent. Madhavananda is under my protection so how can the Lord of Death harm him?"

Only half-conscious I was taken to Mahaprabhuji, who put his blessed hand upon my head.

"My son, the duty I have assigned to you must be fulfilled by you. Don't worry, you will soon be healthy again."

From this moment I began to recover quickly and was soon restored to normal health.

Another time I had a guinea worm, a dangerous parasite that causes great pain. The worm had penetrated the skin of my leg and while trying to pull it out, I broke it, causing myself even greater distress.

I was lying on a mattress on the terrace of the ashram , hardly able to bear the pain, when I overheard a conversation between Mahaprabhuji and Pandit Sobhag Chandji from Ladanu.

Pandit Sobhag Chandji was leaving the ashram on an errand and had come to say goodbye to Mahaprabhuji.

"If you allow, I will just quickly go to the village to arrange some things and be back at the hour of prayer."

Mahaprabhuji tried to hold him back.

"Panditji, don't go. It is winter and it will be dark before you return. You could get lost and if it rained you would have a terrible night."

The village was only a few kilometres away from the ashram , but it was not improbable that one could get lost, for there were no streets to lead the way and at night one was only guided by the stars. However, Panditji didn't listen to the warning of Gurudeva.

"Master, I know exactly the way and surely won't get lost. Also, it's unlikely that we'll have rain because it almost never rains in winter and the sky is without a cloud."

"All right then, but hurry up."

Panditji left the ashram and went to Khatu village to arrange his affairs, but this took him longer than expected and he was only able to start back after sunset. About half way to the ashram it began to rain and just as Mahaprabhuji had warned, Panditji became lost with no idea at all in which direction the ashram lay.

Driven by necessity, he spent a highly uncomfortable night under a tree, shivering from the wet and cold. At dawn the rain stopped and to his great surprise, Panditji realized he was only several hundred metres from the ashram .

Meekly he stood before Mahaprabhuji and apologised.

"Lord, I now know what happens to those who don't follow your words. I believe in you but sometimes what you say sounds so incredible or unlikely, how can I know what to take seriously and what not?"

Mahaprabhuji smiled at him.

"Take heed of all words from Saints and wise men. Always search for the truth in them, regardless of how casual they may sound."

Panditji entered my room where I was still lying in great agony. He told me his experience but I could hardly follow the story because of my pain.

Mahaprabhuji then entered the room.

"Madhav, why do you lament? Everyone must bear the fruits of their karma . You will not liberate yourself by complaining."

"Master, I know that you can liberate me from my karma !" I cried.

But Mahaprabhuji was dismissive.

"I am not your servant, always available, nor am I your doctor."

"You are the doctor who can cure the whole universe!" I insisted. "You have liberated me from several karmas , why does this particularly painful one remain?"

Mahaprabhuji took a piece of turmeric root from his pocket and gave it to me.

"Here you are. Take it and eat it and your pain will disappear."

As I ate the root the pain immediately diminished and that same evening the worm and my pain had completely gone and I was healthy again.

Unfortunately, it was only a short time later that I didn't fare much better than Panditji. Often we make the mistake of listening only superficially to the words of others, but the Satguru is not like most people, who just talk for fun. The words of Gurudeva always come true, as he knows the future.

The greatest error is to mistake the Guru for a normal person. He may look, walk, talk and act the same, but we really have no imagination of who he truly is. The Guru doesn't make much sensation, nor does he raise his voice to emphasise that he has something important to say. It is up to us to be attentive so that we don't miss the wisdom and hidden warnings in his words.

Mostly the Guru will only make a single remark, without any direct warning, to teach the disciple to improve his awareness and decision-making abilities in realizing these hints. If we make the mistake of ignoring his words, we will be taught a lesson. The following story is exactly about this.

## [My Blind Journey](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1601-my-blind-journey)

I asked Mahaprabhuji's permission to make a satsang journey. He permitted it on the condition that I remain within the state of Rajasthan.

"He who travels blind, will become blind," he warned.

I didn't pay careful attention to his words and only heard him grant approval for my trip. I had visited a couple of villages on my journey when I came to the road that led to Abu and then decided to pay a short visit to Palanpur in the state of Gujarat. I had simply forgotten that Mahaprabhuji had told me to remain in Rajasthan.

Immediately upon my arrival in Palanpur, my eyes began to burn and hurt. The next day I visited a doctor but his treatment was without effect. I went to Gandhidham to Dr. Iyengar, a disciple of mine who cared for me with much love and professional attention. His treatment lasted for more than one month but the pain only increased and my eyesight continued to deteriorate.

I decided to go to Dr. Arjun Singh, the eye specialist in Siva-Ganj in Rajasthan. He took me to his hospital in Marwar Junction but still my eyes did not respond to the medication, so I went to Ajmer where I was cared for by Dr. Manohar Singhji and his father, who were both disciples of Mahaprabhuji. But they also were unable to heal me and losing all hope, told me that probably there was no cure for my pain.

By this time I had a constant, almost unbearable, burning pain in both eyes. I could hardly see and the pain prevented me from sleeping.

During the night I prayed to Mahaprabhuji.

"Lord, I can't bear such painful living any more, rather allow me to die."

I repeated my prayer several times and some time later fell asleep. I dreamed and in my dream saw the beloved face of my Master.

"I told you only to travel within the state of Rajasthan, but blindly you disregarded my order. This pain is the result. But now I shall tell you how to improve. Tomorrow morning soak some chapati bread in buttermilk and put it on your eyes. In two days you will be cured. Then return to me."

As soon as possible I followed these instructions and the next day was almost free from pain. I repeated the treatment and like Mahaprabhuji had said, I was cured within two days.

Dr. Manohar Singhji and his father were deeply impressed with my recovery and Mahaprabhuji's infinite mercy. They accompanied me to Bola Guda where Mahaprabhuji was waiting at the door of the Shivbagh Ashram.

He smiled when he saw us.

"Now, Madhav, will you again travel so blindly?"

I bowed at his feet and asked for forgiveness and he blessed me.

Mahaprabhuji invited Dr. Manohar Singhji and his father to stay for dinner at the ashram and told me to prepare halva for the evening. Halva is a dessert made of semolina, ghee, sugar, almonds and raisins. Unfortunately I burnt the halva so it became much darker than usual and I was afraid that nobody would like it.

After the evening prayer I served the halva , giving a portion to everyone. To my great surprise it tasted delicious. Never before had I eaten such wonderful halva ! Everyone else also liked it and this to me was a sign that Mahaprabhuji had really forgiven me.

Later, whenever I met Dr. Manohar Singhji or his father we talked about this blessed evening and the wonderful halva , which by the mercy of Mahaprabhuji tasted like Divine ambrosia.

## [To Wander or To Settle?](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1607-to-wander-or-to-settle)

At all times Mahaprabhuji stayed in his ashram , only leaving it to hold satsangs elsewhere, on special invitation or request from his devotees.

One day I asked him, "There's a saying that water must flow to remain clear and fresh and it is said that a sadhu must always wander in order to preserve his purity. How should I understand this?"

"Still water in small quantity, such as in a pool or a pond, will soon become stagnant, but the immeasurable ocean which also remains in one place doesn't become thick or polluted but instead retains its purity," Mahaprabhuji answered. "In the same way, a sadhu wrapped in the service of others retains a pure mind, even if he is permanently settled. A sadhu with limited knowledge shouldn't dwell in one place for a long time, as he runs the risk of being caught in the spider web of maya . A sadhu with deeper knowledge is never entangled in this web, but on the contrary, frees countless others from it who suffer from worldly longing and desire."

## [It Rains After a Wish](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1594-it-rains-after-a-wish)

During the monsoon when resident in Khatu, Mahaprabhuji held a satsang hosted by  Thakur Revat Singh. I was also present. In that year it had not yet rained and crops in the fields were about to wither and die. The river had no water and ponds and wells were also dry. The cattle and birds had nothing to drink and the farmers were very worried.

Some inhabitants from the nearby village of Kachras came to Mahaprabhuji.

"Lord, the sky is always covered with clouds but no rain falls. Please be gracious to us and let it rain so that our lives may be saved!"

"Don't worry," Mahaprabhuji said. "This year will yield a good crop. Hold a fire ceremony at your watering-place and through this, rain will come. Pandit Mathuraprasad and Madhavananda will prepare the ceremony. Don’t worry, I will fulfil your wish."

Instantly we departed to prepare everything for the fire ceremony, but we noticed that the cloud cover had started to break up and soon there was a cloudless, bright and sparkling blue sky above us.

"How shall it rain now?" the people began to wonder.

When Mahaprabhuji arrived with some devotees at the place of the ceremony, the villagers had gathered and all respectfully greeted him.

With his own hands Mahaprabhuji poured some ghee [1] into the ceremonial fire.

"Within a short while rain will come," he said. "Now quickly distribute prasad to all."

While prasad was being distributed, the sky rapidly covered with clouds and a thunderstorm began to brew. After a short time rain fell and the people rejoiced! The pond was filled and the trees and fields greedily drank the heavenly raindrops.

The whole village praised Mahaprabhuji as the giver of life: "You are the protector of all living beings by your grace we are endowed with gifts!"

Such miracles appear to be unbelievable! Even today I am touched with inner emotion as I think of this day of rain and when­ever I'm in the region of Kachras I clearly see the bene­volent face of Mahaprabhuji, as if he really stood before me.

## [Perfect Happiness](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1583-perfect-happiness)

As my life with him began, I had the feeling that I was home at last.

After I had been nearly one month in joyful service to my Guru , he said to me, "You need to go home now and inform your parents of your decision."

I would have preferred never to separate from him again but I obeyed the wish of my beloved Master and went to Nipal, my home village. Shortly afterwards, Mahaprabhuji also left Jodhpur and returned to Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram at Bari Khatu.

My parents were relieved to have me home again but to begin with they didn't appreciate my decision to live with my holy Master for, like all parents, they wished that I follow on with family life in the way they did. Eventually they seemed to reconcile themselves to the idea, trying only to prolong my stay with them by making it as pleasant as possible.

However, soon I had the feeling that they were only playing for time in order to convince me to change my mind. So, one night, I silently left my parents home and went to Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram, which is nearly three-hundred kilometres from Nipal.

It was only when I saw Mahaprabhuji again that the thirst of my soul was quenched and peace and happiness returned to my heart.

"Lord," I implored him, "let me be your devotee and disciple forever!"

"My son, you are mine and I am yours," Mahaprabhuji said, taking my hand. "Calm your mind and don't worry. Matters will now proceed to your satisfaction and all your desires will be fulfilled."

He paused, then continued.

"I have four jobs to offer and you may choose one. The first is employment with the British Government, the second with the Indian Government, the third with the Muslim Government and the fourth with the Government of the Saints. With which Government would you like to be employed?"

As he spoke, I felt his Light flowing through my body and words leapt eagerly to my lips.

"O Mahaprabhuji, make me a servant in the Kingdom of Saints!"

"Should I?" he teased.

"Oh, yes!" I answered.

The Lord of Mercy closed his eyes for about two minutes and changed my fortune. He planned a blessed future for me. Then he opened his eyes and looked at me full of mercy and blessed my head with his hands.

"I have employed you. From today on you need not worry about how to live. I will give you an orange dress and you will never have to search for another job."

He continued, "Fortune can be changed by the Satguru and not even Brahma can alter what the Satguru has decided."

I looked into his face and experienced such transcendental joy, as if my heart were filled with all the pleasures of the world.

In the morning I had a vision during meditation. I saw Mahaprabhuji on a huge throne decorated with jewels and radiating Divine Light. All around could be heard the mantra ,

OM SATYA BRAHMA SRI DEEP PARI PURAN NARAYAN NAMAH

"O true Brahman, Sri Deep Narayan, Highest Self, I devote myself to you."

I saw Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, as well as many other gods and Saints. I was filled with the deepest joy at being permitted to see these holy and Saintly beings. From within my soul I began to chant with them the song in glory of Mahaprabhuji.

Since that time I have prayed the mantra ,

Om Namoh Satya Brahma Sri Deep Narayan Namah

"OM, my greetings and devotion to the true Brahma, Sri Deep Narayan."

This mantra is filled with Divine Light, truth, peace and joy. Everywhere and in everything I see his Divine Light and hear the sound of his name, which vibrates in this mantra .

All living beings praise and chant this mantra . Earth, fire, water, air and space resonate in this mantra . Trees, fruit, flowers, leaves, lakes, rivers and mountains repeat this mantra . Wherever I am this mantra is with me. In all spheres, in every living creature I hear this mantra . Maya spreads her net, she grows and subsides to eventually disappear, but for me this mantra is even in her.

The whole universe is created by this power and dissolves into it again. The sun, moon and stars attain their light from Vishwa Deep, the One Light in all. It is the Light of the universe. There is no place in the three spheres that isn't lit by its radiance, nor fails to resonate with the echo of his holy name.

The sound of "OM Namoh Satya Brahma Sri Deep Narayan Namah" and the radiance of the cosmic Light fills everything. Since the moment his Light touched my innermost soul, I see Sri Deep Mahaprabhuji everywhere. In each atom this mantra vibrates.

A short time after my arrival, Mahaprabhuji went to stay for a few days in the Sri Deep Narayan Bagichi outside Khatu village and I went with him. The satsangs there, which hundreds of people attended, were a blissful experience. Never before had I witnessed such Divine moments filled with clarity and holy wisdom.

I recall that I prayed again and again, "Dear God, please grant me such satsangs and such a companion in every life!"

That was the very beginning of my life with my Divine Master and in this book I have told some of the many wonderful stories that happened in the years that followed.

## [On the Banks of a River](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1605-on-the-banks-of-a-river)

Sometimes Mahaprabhuji would walk with me at Mount Abu and during one of our excursions through the jungle, we came to the banks of a river and lingered there for some time.

After awhile, Mahaprabhuji asked me, "Madhavananda, what do you see here?"

"O my Lord, this river is enormously beautiful," I replied enthusiastically. "The rhythmic sound of the ripples, the lush green grass on its banks and the small round pebbles are all enchanting. The natural beauty of this place is truly breathtaking."

Smiling, Mahaprabhuji looked at me.

"My child, this is only a beautiful vision of the external world. Indeed the pebbles are colourful and pleasant to look at, but in reality are worthless. Different in their size and weight, among these millions there may only be a few of the same size. Just like among the billions of men and women who have outer beauty, only few possess knowledge of the truth. The lives of all the others are futile and wasted when this knowledge is lacking."

## [My Second Journey to Gujarat](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1608-my-second-journey-to-gujarat)

Sri Pareek had given me valuable help with the publication of Mahaprabhuji's book, Sri Vigyan Deep Gita , but he had never personally met Gurudeva. As I was preparing to return to Bola Guda Ashram, Sri Pareek expressed the wish to accompany me with his family, so that he could at last greet Gurudeva. One day before our departure he received a call from the railway head office in Bombay, saying that he had to stay because the director general of the railway intended to visit Junagarh. Sri Pareek was very disappointed.

"Again I'm unable to come with you," he said. "It's obvious that still I'm not destined to meet Mahaprabhuji."

"Through the grace of the Master, the impossible can be made possible," I assured him. "I'm sure you'll see Mahaprabhuji."

Sri Pareek fasted the whole day in the name of Gurudeva and during the night continued to pray to Mahaprabhuji. The following morning he received a telephone call from the director general informing him that, due to other urgent matters, he must cancel the visit to Junagarh. Sri Pareek beamed as he passed this message on to me. The same day we departed for Bola Guda, where Mahaprabhuji was staying in the Shivbagh Ashram.

To our great surprise, on reaching the Western Railway Station at Somesar, which is about 12 kilometres from the ashram , we found an oxcart waiting for us!

I questioned the driver as to what had brought him there.

"Mahaprabhuji instructed me to pick you up. He said you would arrive at midday together with a railway officer and his family."

I needn't emphasise how overwhelmed the Pareek family were, not only because Mahaprabhuji had known of their arrival, but also because of his thoughtfulness in sending us a vehicle. Soon we reached the Shivbagh Ashram and went to greet Gurudeva.

For Sri Pareek this visit was fast becoming more valuable than he could ever have anticipated. At the first sight of Mahaprabhuji his soul recognised its Satguru and willingly surrendered to him. He stayed in the ashram for some days and had wonderful conversations with his Master. For Mahaprabhuji it was a great joy to hear the children of the Pareek family sing bhajans , as his love for children was very great.

When the time came for the family to leave, Mahaprabhuji asked, "Is there any wish you have that I could fulfil? You mustn't think a sadhu has nothing to give, for in the Kingdom of Gurudeva, every wish is granted."

"My only wish is bhakti and everlasting devotion to Thee," Sri Pareek humbly replied.

Mahaprabhuji nodded in approval.

Sri Pareek's wife however, had more practical sense and she requested her husband's promotion. Mahaprabhuji granted this to her with a smile.

"May it be so."

A short time after, Gurudeva's blessing was fulfilled and Sri Pareek was promoted to a more important post with headquarters in Bombay. Further honours and higher posts followed and wherever he was stationed during his excellent career, he remained a faithful devotee of Mahaprabhuji.

When Sri Pareek left the world, he died with the name of Mahaprabhuji on his lips.

## [Control of the Mind](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1599-control-of-the-mind)

"For many years now I have regularly practised yoga. Daily at four o'clock I pray, meditate and worship God through the recitation of mantras and bhajans , yet still I have not achieved peace of mind. During my spiritual exercises, my thoughts wander with even greater frequency than during other activities. I've tried my best to be master of my thoughts but without success. Please tell me whether or not one is able to gain control of the mind and if so, then with which technique?"

"Panditji, the Mind is a great deceiver," Mahaprabhuji said with a gentle smile. "It is King of the Western world and has brought all under its dictatorship. Also very mighty are the officers of the mind such as passion, irritability, attachment, greed, sorrow, joy, fear, longing, hope, grief and jealousy. Spiritual practice is the only way to annihilate this hostile army but as soon as you try to kill them, they attack with greater force, determined to maintain control over you. In particular they like to attack the spiritual seeker and aspirant. Only with God's help can victory over them be sure. Without this, it's not possible.

"Panditji, tomorrow at sunrise when you sit for meditation, direct your thoughts towards me and begin your meditation by entrusting me with your mind. Afterwards come here and report how you have fared."

The next morning before meditation Panditji bowed before Mahaprabhuji's picture and entrusted to him his mind. Peace and quiet came to his mind and he enjoyed his meditation. The army of his mind had disappeared with the mere thought of Vishwa Deep, just as the stars grow pale at the rising of the sun.

The pandit was very impressed and after finishing his morning practice, hurried to Mahaprabhuji with a happy heart.

"Master of mercy, due to the spiritual exercises I have practised over the years, your vision has now been granted to me! Never before have I experienced such inner peace and joy as today. Your heavenly bliss and happiness have penetrated me, inside and out. Please tell me how it was possible. Have you bewitched me in some way or bestowed your power on me?"

"Only if Gurudeva is present as witness to your spiritual practice can it be successful," Mahaprabhuji answered him. "Only the Divine power of the Satguru can bring peace to the mind of the disciple."

## [The Omniscient Mahaprabhu](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1617-the-omniscient-mahaprabhu)

In order to pass on the Light of Truth to humans, God often uses his devotees as mediators, therefore time and again people came to me who required the help of Gurudeva.

In Udaipur I came to know Thakur Sri Pratap Singh, the successor of a royal family. He was a man of great openness and generosity, though he exhibited a tendency to aggression and passion. He didn't conceal the fact that he liked to drink wine and indulge in gourmet meals. Although he had squandered a fortune, he was still not willing to change his ways. In his generosity, however, he supported me in the printing of my book and when I returned to the ashram , he and his family decided to come so that they could meet my Divine Master.

The moment he stood before Mahaprabhuji, Sri Pratap Singh, who hardly ever had a virtuous thought in his life, experienced a wonderful change. He knelt down and in a firm voice spoke to Mahaprabhuji.

"Master, from this day on no-one in my family shall touch meat or alcohol and this I swear to you on my life!"

"My dear, I never mentioned a word to you about your eating habits. What makes you speak like this?" Mahaprabhuji asked with a gentle smile.

"Lord, you did not speak aloud but I heard the word of your grace within my heart!"

This is the effect of a true Master. Without having to utter a single word, through his mere presence the inner Self is purified and turned towards good. The thakur kept his word and from that day on was truly devoted to Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji.

On another visit to Udaipur I met Sri N.G. Joshi from Jaipur, who showed great interest in Mahaprabhuji and therefore invited me to stay with him. Sri Joshi was a religious man, a learned astrologer and chiromancer. In India these sciences are held in honour even today.

Sri Joshi began to tell me things which were otherwise known only to Mahaprabhuji and myself. I began to tell him about Mahaprabhuji. He was surprised to know that at present there was a Divine power incarnated in India. Attentively he listened to what I said and inwardly he scrutinized the abilities of Mahaprabhuji.

Without my knowledge he sent an employee to Mahaprabhuji with the instruction to have him Divine where the servant had come from and who had sent him. He also told the employee two questions that he wanted answered by Mahaprabhuji.

The employee travelled to Khatu by train and was heartily welcomed by Mahaprabhuji.

"It's a long journey from Udaipur to here," he said. "You must certainly be tired and hungry."

Mahaprabhuji gave instructions for someone to bring food.

"I see Sri Joshi has sent you and I also see that he has been struggling in vain for a promotion in his firm. Tell him he should travel to Bombay this month and try once again. When he steps into the office of his superior he should think of me and instantly he will receive the desired promotion."

The messenger was speechless and no doubt felt somewhat intimidated. He stayed in the ashram overnight. Early the next morning he hurried back to Udaipur to give an account of his meeting to Sri Joshi. On hearing all that had happened, Sri Joshi came to my room and bowed before Mahaprabhuji's picture.

"Swamiji, the Divine Master has blessed me," he told me excitedly. "I wanted to test him. Please forgive me for what I have done behind your back but now I'm convinced of his divinity."

It's almost unnecessary for me to say it, but all that Maha­prabhuji had said would happen, happened in just that way.

## [Mahaprabhuji's Eye Operation](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1614-mahaprabhujis-eye-operation)

There came a time when the disciples around Mahaprabhuji realized that his eyesight was failing. Frequently they requested that he consult a doctor but he refused.

"Why should I?" he said. "My physical eyes are not important. What counts is what I see with my inner eye. Even if I were to become completely blind I would still see all of Heaven and earth and into the souls of men. Don't be concerned with my body. Anchored in the bliss of eternal happiness I am only a witness to my physical state."

Still the disciples worried about the health of their beloved Gurudeva. They knew his eyes had cataracts and that only an operation could help, so they continued to urge him to accept medical help.

"Master, please permit me to arrange a date for your operation in the hospital of Ajmer," a disciple said to him one day. "I will take care of everything myself and make sure that you receive the best possible medical attention. Please allow me to do this small service."

When Mahaprabhuji saw that this was the sincere wish of so many of his devotees, he finally agreed.

"Well, I'm prepared to go since you wish it so much, therefore make the necessary arrangements."

The day came for Mahaprabhuji to depart for Ajmer and the villagers who had come to know of this were very concerned as they said goodbye to their beloved Master. In their fear of hospitals and because of the terrible stories that they had heard, they were afraid Mahaprabhuji would leave them forever.

Gurudeva was welcomed in the St. Francis Hospital of Ajmer by Dr. Ram Gopal, a well-known neurologist from Rajasthan. Dr. Sri Amba Lal conducted the examination of Mahaprabhuji's eyes, which confirmed that an operation was necessary.

In the operating theatre Mahaprabhuji refused anaesthetic, saying that he didn't require it. At the surgeon's hesitation Mahaprabhuji once more assured him, "You can safely carry out the operation. Trust my words!"

With this, Mahaprabhuji entered into a state of transcendental consciousness in which his body was free of every sensation. On completion of the surgery the doctor was shocked to find Mahaprabhuji wasn't breathing and showed no other signs of life. Silently he prayed to the Lord for help.

At that moment Mahaprabhuji fully aware, smiled.

"Do you have such little faith? I won't leave my body so casually. It was only for the duration of the operation that I withdrew my consciousness for you to work undisturbed."

He added, "But it did take longer than you expected!"

Later, I had a chance to speak with Dr Amba Lal myself and he told me that the moment Mahaprabhuji became conscious again after the operation, was one of the happiest moments of his life. He felt it a great blessing to perform the operation for Mahaprabhuji and humbly receive his blessing.

During the actual surgery I was in Ahmedabad, so I received the message of Mahaprabhuji's visit to hospital by a letter from Dr Amba Lal.

He explained the medical situation to me and added, "I've come across many holy men and swamis but never one like Sri Mahaprabhuji. It was a great honour for me to be of service to such a great Saint."

He closed the letter with a message from Mahaprabhuji that I should travel to Ajmer without delay. I lost no time and on arriving in Ajmer went directly to him for a joyous and blissful reunion with my Gurudeva.

The devotees of Ajmer were very happy to have their beloved Master with them and they took great care that while in hospital he lacked no comfort. During the whole day visitors came to him and despite his recent surgery, Mahaprabhuji held satsang daily.

Members of all religions came. The Muslims praised him as an incarnation of the prophet Mohammed, Christians called him the manifestation of the love and grace of Jesus Christ, Sikhs worshipped him as their Guru Nanak. All people, no matter what their religion, sensed a feeling of fulfilment at the sight of Mahaprabhuji. He received everyone with a loving heart, as he is the messenger of the Divine word and embodiment of all that is good. For those who came to him, his answers were those of their holy scriptures.

## [Blessing of Mahaprabhuji](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1596-blessing-of-mahaprabhuji)

It was one of Sri Mahaprabhuji's special graces that the lives of those who came to him as disciples became materially secure and comfortable. It was not that they amassed fortunes, or that money came easily, but through Gurudeva's blessing their work was fruitful.

In the village of Kachras there lived a poor brahmin family with their son, Choga Lal. The lad was very intelligent and well-behaved and the parents sent him to me so that I could teach him to read and write. Willingly, he would sit beside Mahaprabhuji and sing a song or prayer for Gurudeva.

One day Mahaprabhuji laid his hand on the boy's head in blessing.

"God bless you, my son," he said. "Your life will always be easy and pleasant, but you ought never to forget me. Constantly carry the holy name of God in your heart as His name brings perfection to the person who always remembers Him."

Just as Mahaprabhuji had promised, Choga Lal grew up to become a wealthy businessman and his life was happy and successful. He led a simple and righteous life and was charitable to the poor. Several times a year he invited swamis to his house to hold satsang .

But if devotion is not true and if the mind and consciousness are not purified, the result can be completely different. This is what happened to Balji Heda.

## [Balji Heda's Dream of Wealth](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1597-balji-hedas-dream-of-wealth)

There were always devotees who made great efforts to stay as close as possible to Mahaprabhuji in order to serve him. One of these was a poor merchant named Balji Heda, who had a burning desire to be rich. He served Mahaprabhuji with great enthu­siasm. He made use of himself wherever he could, sweeping the ashram , washing the dishes, fetching wood. He didn't move from Mahaprabhuji's side.

One day Mahaprabhuji asked him his greatest wish, though he knew the answer very well.

"Balji, do you have a wish?"

Balji, who had only been waiting for this very moment, replied without hesitation.

"Master, you see into the hearts of all and nothing is hidden from you, but if you want to hear my greatest wish then I will tell you about it. I want to be a rich man and if you grant me this wish I will build a guest house near the railway station of Khatu so that all pilgrims who come to visit you here may lodge with me in free accommodation. Gurudeva, I firmly believe in your grace, you will not disappoint me."

And with this Balji worked himself into a state of wishful thinking and made great plans, talking about the facilities he would offer pilgrims who came to visit the Master.

On hearing Balji Heda speak in this way, Mahaprabhuji sadly shook his head.

"Even if by Gurudeva's grace you possessed all the money in the world, still you would not perform this selfless work," he said with a smile. "I know you well. Your mind is filled with greed and stinginess. A man like you couldn't make this sacrifice any more than a goat could swallow a watermelon whole."

Balji was offended by these words and tears filled his eyes.

"You are gracious and helpful towards all, so why not to me? Give me a chance. All I need is the opportunity to earn more and then I will prove to you that I can keep my promise. Let me try just once!"

Mahaprabhuji became serious.

"Balji, I gave you chances in several lives already and every time you failed. I know you and know things of which you are not even aware."

But Balji didn’t relent.

"Ocean of Grace, try me just once more, I beg you. This time I will not disappoint you. Please fulfil my wish."

Finally Mahaprabhuji granted his request and directed him to Bombay and to try his luck. Immediately Balji travelled there and by speculating on the stock exchange, won three million rupees in just one week. Everyone admired his extraordinary luck and the news of his sudden wealth spread like wildfire, finally reaching his home village of Khatu.

He arrived home with many precious objects and was warmly welcomed. In reality, it was not he who was praised but his money and soon he had many new friends who longed to be in his company.

Balji had not forgotten Mahaprabhuji. He had brought him a valuable cashmere shawl and some fruits. Mahaprabhuji accepted the gifts and distributed the fruit as prasad among the disciples. He handed the shawl to a poor farmer who sat nearby. In his merciful nature, Mahaprabhuji always passed on precious gifts to the beggars and poor.

"Lord!" Balji protested, "this valuable shawl is intended for you. You ought to keep it."

With a smile Mahaprabhuji replied, "At all times in this world, fear lurks hidden beneath precious things. If I were to keep every valuable gift, I would soon have need to build a storehouse and lock it to protect my belongings. Humans very easily become attached to their possessions and then the fear of losing them begins."

"Balji, there is another good reason why this particular man should have your shawl," he continued. "It is a beautiful shawl and the man is very poor. How often in his life will the opportunity come to possess something so expensive? It is so good to share a joy! You have taken pleasure in giving me this shawl, so do not rob me of the pleasure of passing it on."

Balji's limited mind just could not grasp these words, nevertheless he accepted Gurudeva's decision.

Mahaprabhuji's disciples often expressed that he should keep the gifts for his own use, but he believed otherwise.

"If I don't give these to the poor, how should I otherwise take pleasure in such gifts? Just as the lake doesn't drink its own water and the tree doesn't eat its own fruit, so the Saint only ever lives for the benefit of others."

Mahaprabhuji lived very simply. He wore handwoven garments made of cotton and even mended his old clothes himself.

"Gurudeva, you could dress in the finest silk or velvet and still pass on rich presents to the poor," his disciples frequently said. "Why do you wear such old, patched garments?"

Mahaprabhuji would answer, "Verily, nobody becomes great just by wearing splendid clothes, but only through their inner qualities."

After some time, Balji Heda started to think about the guest house which he had promised to build. He was ready to order the first load of bricks when his stinginess began to take hold.

"Why should I do this?" he thought. "When I come to think of it, my wealth is the result of my own luck. What had Mahaprabhuji to do with it? If he really had the power to make people rich, why doesn't he do so for all disciples? It's foolish of me to waste my money on this guest house."

Mahaprabhuji knew about Balji Heda’s change of heart.

"Balji, I would like to remind you of your promise," he warned. "If you break your word, you will not only lose all your money but your dharma as well. Like a beggar you will wander from door to door. You are mistaken if you think that wealth is your destiny. You will then see what course this supposed luck will take you."

However, Balji was blinded by his love for money and after some time, he went to Jodhpur to gamble on the stock exchange again. But this time luck abandoned him and he lost his wealth as fast as he had won it. Hoping to regain his money, he continued to gamble but only lost more and more. He even borrowed money, hoping his luck would change, but still he lost.

Thus Balji fell into misery and really was compelled to wander from door to door to beg for help. In this time of distress Balji remembered Mahaprabhuji's words and recognised his mistake. He realized that his mind had been blinded by greed and that he had to suffer punishment.

A true picture of misery, Balji sought the help of Mahaprabhuji.

Crying and filled with repentance, he threw himself at Gurudeva's feet. Seeing him in this sad condition Maha­prabhuji spoke softly.

"Balji, you were very proud of your wealth. Wealth is Goddess Lakshmi and it operates according to her nature — unstable. It is not in your power to control Lakshmi. You thought that your own luck had made you a millionaire, but what has become of your luck? Where is the money which you so ostensibly earned? You pressed me to give you a chance and this I did, but unfortunately you failed. You only have yourself to blame for this miserable situation because you didn't keep your word. Whoever breaks his word will suffer the consequences, this is the law of karma ."

Balji realized that his own efforts couldn't free him from his miserable plight and so he stayed in Mahaprabhuji's ashram for three months. He resumed his former services and cleaned the ashram daily.

One day Mahaprabhuji spoke to him.

"Now you must go home again. In future you will be able to earn enough to repay your debts, but you will never be rich."

Balji obeyed and left the ashram . He did not lack anything and he no longer dreamed of wealth. For some years more he lived in thoughts of repentance and in memory of his days of wealth and then he left this world.

## [Sri Bhatnagar Becomes Mahaprabhuji's Disciple](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1612-sri-bhatnagar-becomes-mahaprabhujis-disciple)

I travelled widely in Gujarat and gave lectures in many places, including Rajkot and Gondal. In Gondal I stayed with Sri B. L. Sharma, a senior officer of the railway and in his house I held several satsangs to which many other railway employees came. One of these was Sri S. P. Bhatnagar, the personnel manager, who considered himself agnostic.

After one satsang , he asserted, "I believe such gatherings to be misleading and a waste of time. These gullible listeners are given all sorts of unrealiztic promises of happiness when in reality life is hard and cruel and everyone is on their own!"

I was unable to accept his remark in silence.

"You've never met a mahatma and only because of this you speak in that way. If you'd ever met a realized Master, your eyes would have opened and you would see that I have spoken the pure truth."

"You may be right," Sri Bhatnagar remarked. "Maybe a mahatma is able to help us but until now I've only seen swindlers. I have met many who pass themselves off as wise and holy but not one was able to impart realization and knowledge of God."

On hearing this, I felt that standing before me was someone who was in need of Mahaprabhuji's help.

"Come with me to my Master, Mahaprabhuji. He's an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and when you come to know him, you'll experience that God's power on earth acts in him."

He agreed to come with me and in order to test Mahaprabhuji's abilities, he secretly prepared a list of forty questions on complicated religious and philosophical subjects such as God, karma and reincarnation. These he hid in his purse.

Our journey to Bola Guda took several days. When we reached Shivbagh Ashram, Mahaprabhuji was walking around outside. We greeted him and with a gentle smile Mahaprabhuji turned to my companion.

"Be welcome, Bhatnagar. Now you have finally arrived at the right place, your search is over. You carry with you a list of forty questions. I can answer more if you wish, eighty or a hundred! Knowledge is God's heavenly prasad which I have come to distribute in this world."

Sri Bhatnagar stood there completely perplexed, unable to utter any word in reply, so Mahaprabhuji invited him to freshen up after the long journey.

"Take a rest and later we'll speak with each other."

After taking some fruit and tea, Sri Bhatnagar went to Mahaprabhuji, who invited him to sit down. Sri Bhatnagar was uncertain how Mahaprabhuji had known of his intentions.

While sitting at his feet, Sri Bhatnagar reflected, "Until now my forty questions were never answered to my satisfaction by any scholar, Saint, Master, mahatma or Jagat Guru . If Mahaprabhuji should answer my questions in such a way that my mind is liberated from all doubt and finds peace at last, then I will wholly acknowledge him. If not, then I will expose him in public."

Mahaprabhuji addressed Sri Bhatnagar.

"Now tell me, how shall I answer your questions? Outwardly — or inwardly, to your conscience?"

"Answer twenty questions outwardly and twenty inwardly, so that I may have both experiences." Sri Bhatnagar decided.

Mahaprabhuji began to explain the answers to the first twenty questions and in that moment, convinced Sri Bhatnagar of his unique spiritual knowledge. Sri Bhatnagar sat with closed eyes, absorbing every word. After these first twenty questions Mahaprabhuji left his seat to join a discussion with other devotees some distance away.

Sri Bhatnagar remained seated with closed eyes as the wondrous discussion with the Master continued in his mind and in this way he received answers to the other twenty questions. Much, much later he opened his eyes and realized that Mahaprabhuji was no longer with him but was speaking to others some metres away. Astonished, he reflected upon this miracle. In this hour Sri Bhatnagar became a believer in God, convinced of Mahaprabhuji's divinity.

He rose and walked to Mahaprabhuji, then prostrated himself.

"Merciful Master, you have opened my eyes and removed the veils of ignorance. Today for the first time I have ex­pe­rienced the truth!"

During the night Sri Bhatnagar had another wonderful experience. As soon as he lay down and closed his eyes, a bright, sparkling light appeared which illuminated the whole universe. For over an hour he remained in the delightful state of samadhi , then he opened his eyes and knelt down before Mahaprabhuji and prayed:

"Mahaprabhu Deep, you yourself are the blissful, Divine Light! Please grant me your grace, too. You are indescribable, only a few can understand you. All others, with such deplorable fate, live in blind ignorance in this world. I pray that your Divine radiance shall illuminate my inner and outer Self."

Sri Bhatnagar stayed at the ashram for several days. When finally the time came for him to return, he asked Mahaprabhuji if he could do anything for him.

"The whole universe is my Atma and I am the Atma of the universe," Mahaprabhuji answered. "Live your life in such a way as to bring benefit to the whole world. If you serve humans and all living beings, then you are serving me. My Atma is also your Atma. However, if you want to give me something, promise me to lead your life according to the Truth."

I accompanied Sri Bhatnagar to the railway station at Somesar. It was a difficult farewell for him.

"Now the obligations of my work separate me from my Gurudeva," he said sadly.

"Mahaprabhuji is Omniscient and Omnipotent," I assured him. "Wherever and whenever you think of him, he will appear before you."

Soon after that, Sri Bhatnagar moved to Baroda and he called me there to assist in the printing of a collection of Mahaprabhuji's bhajans under the title of Sri Deep Puri Anubhava Prakasha . I was to take 1000 copies with me and deliver them as a gift to Mahaprabhuji.

Mahaprabhuji returned to Sri Deva Dungary Sannyas Ashram and Sri Bhatnagar together with his family visited for ten days. During this time he requested Mahaprabhuji to reveal the secrets of Creation. Thereupon Gurudeva drew him a kind of diagram to use as illustration in explanation of the whole phenomenon of the Cosmos, its origin, existence and eventual dissolution into God. Sri Bhatnagar often recalled this experience and with much gratitude.

He lived a righteous life with his family. He raised his ten children with love and respect for Mahaprabhuji and all were truly devoted to him and lifelong preserved his teachings in their hearts.

After his retirement, Sri Bhatnagar moved to Bombay and when it came time to bid farewell to this world, he left his body in the way of a yogi , with the name of Mahaprabhuji on his lips.

## [Mahaprabhuji's Grace](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/my-life-with-mahaprabuji/1613-mahaprabhujis-grace)

The following year Mahaprabhuji spent the time of monsoon in the village of Bola Guda and I was with him, as were other disciples and sannyasis . Satsang was held daily and it rained often, once continuously for fifteen days. One morning I was sitting in my room engrossed in thought as it had come to my mind to travel to Jamnagar in Gujarat.

In that same moment Mahaprabhuji appeared in my room.

"I have no objection if you want to go to Jamnagar."

"Mahaprabhuji, surely enough I would like to but the railway station of Somesar is twelve kilometres away and how should I get there as long as it continues to rain like this?"

"Tomorrow morning it will stop and it will begin to rain again only after you have boarded the train at Somesar," Mahaprabhuji said, smiling. "If you don't have any money for the ticket, take some from me."

"My Master, you are Omniscient and Omnipotent," I said and folded my hands. "Please give me the money only when I really need it."

Mahaprabhuji then instructed me with some other duties to perform while on my travels.

"Take Purnananda with you to the town of Rani and then send him back with one pound of curcuma and some green vegetables. Also, the fabric covering my umbrella has been eaten by moths. Have it re-covered and sent back so it can be used during the rainy season here. Now tell me, should I give you a little money?"

Bowing down, I repeated, "My Lord, I have already requested that you might give me money when and where I am in need of it."

I had only two rupees in my bag but had full trust in Mahaprabhuji that he would take care of me whenever it was necessary.

The next day I walked to Somesar with Puranand and it was still early in the morning when we boarded the train. After some time, two conductors stepped into our compartment and began checking passengers' tickets. When it came my turn they didn't ask for my ticket but bowed to me in greeting and invited me to share tea and a little snack. I thanked them for their kind offer, but declined.

Arriving at Rani we proceeded to the bazaar to buy fabric for the umbrella. In a store I made enquiries about the cost of some fabric and was told that it cost three rupees but because I only had two rupees I couldn't take it. Soon the sun was beginning to set and since we didn't know anyone in Rani we had no idea where we should spend the night.

"Why haven't you brought any money with you? Now we have to go hungry," Purnananda accused.

"Do not worry," I replied. "Trust in Mahaprabhuji, he will arrange everything. The Omnipresent God is always with us."

While speaking like this we passed a police station.

"Come on, let's go into the guard room," I suggested to Purnananda on a sudden impulse.

Inspector Ram Singhji was sitting in his office and as soon as he saw our orange robes he stepped out and greeted us with folded hands. He requested us to follow him into his room and during our conversation we came to know that the inspector was also a disciple of Mahaprabhuji. Delighted at having met us, he extended an invitation to be his guests for the night, which we thankfully accepted.

Inspector Ram Singhji arranged two beds to be prepared for us on the first floor, with water for drinking and bathing. Next, a delicious meal was cooked and we shared a splendid dinner. I then asked the inspector for his assistance.

"We require a new fabric covering for this umbrella. In the store it was priced at three rupees, but I have only two. Would it be possible for you to ask the store owner if he is prepared to give it to me at this price?"

Instantly the inspector sent a policeman to the store to bring back all the fabric available and very soon the policeman returned with the textiles and the store owner.

"Prepare a new fabric cover for the umbrella of Gurudeva and I will pay for it," the inspector instructed the trader.

This was arranged and so it was that the money I carried was saved. We spent some more time in satsang and then went to rest.

The next morning we got up rather early and went for a walk. On our way we saw the house of Sri R. Sharma, a railway officer.

"Come, we shall visit Sri Sharmaji," I suggested to Purnananda.

"You have such a habit of going into everybody's house," Purnananda remarked. "Sharmaji is an official. Who knows if he would welcome our visit?"

I told him not to worry and to follow me without hesitation. A guard was standing at the garden gate and I asked him to inform Sri Sharmaji of my arrival. Having heard us, Sri Sharmaji was already on his way out to greet us and we were guided inside his office.

"Swamiji, would you please be so kind as to take lunch in my home?" he asked.

"As you wish," I agreed. "However, before that we must buy some green vegetables and one pound of curcuma for Mahaprabhuji."

Sri Sharmaji offered to get these things from the market and he called a servant and handed over a ten-rupee note.

"Buy one pound of curcuma and use the rest of the money for green vegetables."

So I still had the two rupees with me.

We had a hearty lunch at Sri Sharmaji's house. After that I sent Purnananda with the umbrella, curcuma and vegetables back to Mahaprabhuji at Bola Guda while I continued on to Ahmedabad.

But Purnananda thought to himself: "Madhavananda still has the two rupees with him even though we got all these things Mahaprabhuji wanted and now he's going on to Ahmedabad. How is all this possible?"

Seeds of suspicion began to sprout in Purnananda's mind. When he got back to the ashram he called together all Mahaprabhuji's disciples and told them of his experiences in detail.

In conclusion he remarked, "Mahaprabhuji likes Madhavananda more than us. It seems that he has conferred on him and nobody else, a mantra with special power. That's why they didn't check his ticket on the train and instead offered some refreshment. But if any one of us were found without a ticket, we'd be told to get out immediately. Surely this must be due to the effect of a special mantra !"

He continued: "Madhavananda had only two rupees, which is hardly adequate for the train trip from Somesar to Rani, let alone to get all those other things for Mahaprabhuji. From the beginning I asked myself how he could buy these things, where we should stay and what we should eat. First in Rani he hypnotised the police inspector, who then provided us with accommodation and food and even paid for the fabric cover of the umbrella. Next he hypnotised a railway official, who not only served us an ample lunch, but also gave us the one pound of curcuma and the green vegetables!

"Madhavananda surely possesses certain magic powers to which none of us are privy, but why is this so? I think that on the next full-moon satsang we must speak to Mahaprabhuji! We will ask him that if we too have renounced the world to become his disciples, why has he chosen to give a mantra that can control the will of others only to Madhavananda? Why not to us also? We will ask why he has neglected us in this way."

The seed of doubt which had germinated in the mind of Purnananda also spread among the other disciples. On the full moon a large satsang was held. The program began at nine o'clock and after the prayer and greetings to Mahaprabhuji, Purnananda took Sri Bhur Singhji into his confidence.

"Mahaprabhuji makes distinctions between his disciples. He has passed on all his powers to only Madhavananda. Would you please request of Mahaprabhuji that he also give us the same siddha mantras that he has taught Madhavanada?"

In the presence of all, the fair and just Sri Bhur Singhji turned to Mahaprabhuji.

"Lord of Mercy, the seed of doubt and jealousy has begun to sprout in the minds of your disciples. Please remove it at once."

Mahaprabhuji called all disciples together, including Purnananda.

"What causes you pain and what suspicion distresses you?"

The disciples spoke unanimously.

"You don't treat us with equality and you make distinctions between us. The siddha mantra which Madhavananda received from you has not been given to any of us. This vashikarana mantra [1] makes Madhavananda revered wherever he goes, but nobody takes any notice of us. Why is this so?"

"I distribute my grace equally upon all," Mahaprabhuji replied, "but you don't understand how to accept it and use it in the right way, whereas Madhavananda always remains under the protection of my blessing. My grace is like the light of the sun which shines for all beings, nonetheless only a few are capable of taking their energy from the sun. If you are unable to use my grace — which exists for all — to your advantage, then who is to be blamed? If you want to learn the art of winning the hearts of others, I advise you to spend some time with Madhavananda."

On hearing this the disciples became even more angry and distrustful.

"We're not so subordinated to Madhavananda that we should live with him!"

"As long as you suffer from such vanity you will not learn anything!" Mahaprabhuji affirmed. "Only those who have laid down their ego and obey me will discover all. Self-righteousness, pride and jealousy won't achieve anything."



[1] vashikarana mantra = a mantra through which we can fulfil our desires and wishes.

## [The Kumbha Mela in Haridwar 1998](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/vishwaguru-mahamandaleshwar-paramhans-sri-swami-maheshwarananda/1633-the-kumbha-mela-in-haridwar-1998)

A Report by Mr. G. P. Nagar (Jaipur, Rajasthan) and Dr. Radha (Vienna, Austria)



On April 3 rd , 1998, Paramhans Swami Maheshwaranandaji accompanied by many disciples from Vienna, travelled to India to take part in the last significant spiritual event of this millenium, the Maha Kumbha Mela in Haridwar. This journey was undertaken as the World Religious Parliament (India) wanted to confer on our beloved Gurudev Yogiraj Param­hans Sri Swami Maheshwar­anandaji Maharaj, the title of Sarv Bhaum Jagadguru [1] on 10 th April, 1998 and the Maha Nirvani Akhara wanted to consecrate him as Mahamandalesh­war [2] on 13 th April 1998.

At Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, hundreds of disciples from all parts of the globe welcomed Swamiji with flowers and garlands. Travel continued by bus to Rohtak for an overnight stay and then onto the first destination of Kurukshetra, where the historical fight of the Mahabharat took place. It was at Kurukshetra God Krishna bestowed the divine wisdom of Sri Bhagavad Gita on his devotee Arjuna.



KURUKSHETRA

Kurukshetra is one of the most important pilgrimage places of India. It encompasses an area of 48 km² with more than 300 sacred sites. Explaining the meaning of teerath (place of pilgrimage), Mr.G.P.Nagar told the foreign disciples that in Satya Yuga, the "Golden Age" of spirituality and mental powers, great Rishis, Yogis and Kings acquired merit by performing tapas , intense austerities, over many years. By their association with them, the places where they performed tapas became full of spiritual radiance and power. These ancient sages knew that in the dark era of ignorance, man's strength of will and spiritual capacity would deteriorate.

Full of compassion for the coming generations, these holy men dedicated the merit of their sadhana to these sacred places, so that whoever visits there shall gain the benefit of their tapas . By the mercy and blessing of these saints, the karmas of the pilgrims are purified, and their consciousness elevated.

By our good luck our dharamshala (guest house) was situated next to one of these sacred places, Suraj Kund (Lake of the Sun God). On its edge there was a Shiva temple in whose grounds we received our meals, prepared and served with loving care and hospitality.

On the following morning, Swamiji and the group took a tour through the area of Kurukshetra and visited several sacred abodes. First we visited the marvellous site of Isthanishwar Temple. Mahant Swami Prabhatpuriji, the head of this temple welcomed Swamiji and the group, and spoke about the importance and meaning of this ancient shrine. The Shiva–Lingam of this temple was placed there by Lord Brahma himself and before the commencement of the Mahabharat war, Lord Krishna and the Pandavas came here to pray for blessing and victory. After we had received prasad we went through the temple. In front of it is a ritual bathing place and a very old tree which is said to fulfil wishes.

From there, Swamiji took the group to Jyotisar Teerath where Lord Krishna conveyed to Arjuna the teachings of the Holy Gita. Swamiji sat under the famous Akhsai Vat (eternal tree) and his disciples gathered around him – deeply touched by holy atmosphere of this place and the meaning of this very moment. We looked out across the wide plain, where many thousands of years ago the glorious heroes of the Mahabharat fought their fateful combat – "Kurukshetra – Dharmakshetra", the battlefield of Kurus and Pandavas was the arena between justice and injustice, where the Lord himself granted victory to righteousness.

We then saw the place where Pitama Bhishma lay on a cot of arrows. When the great patriarch expressed desire for water, Arjuna released an arrow into the earth where a full jet of water sprang forth from the Ganga to quench the thirst of that mighty warrior, who was waiting for the auspicious day of his death.

Our last visit was to Brahmasarovar, a large lake and holy bathing place with a lovely Shiva temple in its midst. Here at this lake, Lord Vishnu rested on on the thousand–headed serpent and out of his navel emerged Lord Brahma, the creator of the Universe.



HARIDWAR

On 7 th April, Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, accompanied by a group of 250 international disciples, reached Haridwar which is situated on the right side of the sacred river Ganga, at the foot of the Shivalik range of the Himalayas. The river Ganga originates at Gangotri and then reappears for the first time at Haridwar. Since the routes to the sacred Shaiv Shrine of Kedarnath and the equally sacred Vaishnav Shrine of Badrinath pass through this place, it is called Haridwar – Gate of Har or Hari (God).

Here the Ganga flows broadly across several hundred metres, spanned by narrow brigdes. More than 10 km² of the river bank, is covered by makeshift camps of the visitors attending the Maha Kumbha Mela. Millions of pilgrims, lakhs of Yogis, Sadhus, Saints and Spiritual Masters with their disciples have gathered to attend the most auspicious spiritual event in India. Mantras and bhajans sound through thousands of loud–speakers, the fragrance of agarbhati permeates the entire area. Everywhere there is an atmosphere of joyful and solemn radiance.

The holiest place in the area is the bathing platform known as Har ki Paori, dotted with Ganga temples. It is believed that here the ascetic King Bharathari fulfilled his "Vairagya" and "Neeti" Sataks, hence the place is named after him. Just nearby is "Brahm Kund" where Brahma is said to have performed tapas and where drops of amrit (nectar of immorality) fell out of the khumb (vessel). Lord Vishnu is reported to have performed tapas at another nearby location called "Vishnu Ghat". Bhagwan Ram performed shradh of his ancestors at Kushavart Ghat. The Pandavas are also said to have performed tapas at Haridwar.

People from distant parts of North India come to immerse the ashes of their dead relatives into the Ganga at Haridwar. It is said that King Bhagirath brought Ganga to Haridwar to ensure the salvation of 60,000 sons of the ancestor King Sagar.

As the places of religious importance in and around Haridwar are too numerous, we can mention only a few: the temple of Mansa Devi at the top of Bilwa hill; the temple of Chandi Devi at the top of Neel hill; the Vaishnav Devi temple; the Bharat Mata temple and the temple of Paradeswar Mahadev whose Linga is of mercury.

Mayapuri is where Daksha Prajapati performed a yagya (ceremony) to which he did not invite his daughter Sati and her husband Shiva. Sati who had gone to the yagya without invitation, was so disappointed about the insult made to her husband, that she emerged herself in the yagya kund . Taking revenge of her self-sacrifice, the attendants of Lord Shiva cut the head of Daksha Prajapati. Distraught at the death of his wife Shiva started to roam with Sati‘s dead body on his shoulders. In order to wean Shiva away from his dead wife, Lord Vishnu cut her body in pieces  with his chakra .  The pieces fell at 51 places, each of which is a shakti peeth now. King Daksha was subsequently restored to life by Lord Shiva. There is a temple dedicated to him at Kankhal (a district of Haridwar) which is under the supervision of Mahanirvani Akhara.

Kankhal, has more than 100 ashrams belonging to Saints, some of them situated over an area of more than 50,000 square metres.

Rishikesh, is situated at a distance of 23kms from Haridwar. It has nearly 50 ashrams , large and small. Each ashram is managed by Saints or charitable and religious trusts. Not only do they accommodate the swamis, but also pilgrims who come to visit the sacred sites.

The origin of the Kumbha Mela is lost in the hoary past. The Rig Veda and the Puranas make reference to it. Lord Buddha (7 th century B.C.) speaks of it as a river festival. According to the Puranas, the devas (gods) and asuras (demons) decided to churn the ocean. Mount Mandakini was used as the churner and Vasuki the huge serpent, was used as a rope. The gods were at the tail and the demons at the head of the said rope. Many things emerged from the ocean.

First of all Goddess Lakshmi appeared and Lord Vishnu made her his consort. Eventually amrit the nectar of immortality poured out, but with it, a deadly poison. Neither the gods nor the devils knew how to be rid of the poison, which was strong enough to destroy the whole Universe. So gods and demons went to Lord Shiva for advice. Shiva took the poison and drank it. By his Yogic power he held the poison in his Vishuddhi Chakra and purified it there. So the poison did not affect him, only his throat became dark blue and from this Lord Shiva earned the name Nilkant (=blue neck).

When the kumbh (vessel) of nectar emerged from the ocean, both gods and demons rushed to take it. God Indra discretely hinted to his son Jayant to run away with the vessel, which he promptly did. The demons chased him and in the fight that followed, a few drops of nectar fell at Brahm Kund, Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nasik which are situated on the rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Sarasvati, Chipra and Godawari respectively. Since this fight continued for twelve days (and one day in the life of gods equals one year in the life of man), the Kumbha Mela is held at Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nasik every 12 th year. It is also said that the Sun, by its rays, made the vessel of nectar stronger to prevent it from breaking. The Moon, by its gravitational force, prevented the vessel from falling and Lord Brihaspati, by his divine guidance to the gods, prevented the demons from obtaining the nectar.

Therefore a Kumbha Mela is celebrated at Haridwar when the Sun is in Aries and Jupiter in Aquarius. Since Jupiter returns to Aquarius after 12 years, the Kumbha Mela is celebrated after 12 years.

This year the Maha Kumbha Mela started on 14 th January and continued up to 27 th April 1998. The dates of Shahi Snan (the Royal Bath) were 25 th February, 28 th March, 14 th April and 27 th April 1998. Out of these dates, the 14 th of April was the most important for 1998. 2,5 million people bathed in the holy river on 28 th March and another 10 million bathed on 13 th and 14 th of April 1998.

But we will return now to the 7 th of April and report about our stay in Haridwar from the beginning.

At the time of the Kumbha Mela in Haridwar, many ashrams and institutions secure plots of land with tents and podiums for the visiting pilgrims, over an area of 10,000 to 20,000 square metres. In one such an area at Neel Dhara, a distance of only 200 metres from the Ganga with a beautiful view across to the Mansa Devi temple on the opposite hill, the World Religious Parliament (India) and Brahman International erected 50 tents and a spacious podium for the use of Paramhans Swami Maheshwar­ananda and his disciples. On our arrival we were blessed with the darshan of Paramhans Swami Madhavanandaji (Holy Guruji), who had come early to the Mela to help prepare the celebrations for Swamiji.

On the next day we made our first visit to Ganga Mata. According to Swamiji's advice, on this day we only dipped in our feet, to gradually open ourselves to the spiritual energies of the Ganga’s holy waters.

In the afternoon dark clouds began to cover the sky. Lightning flashed and a strong wind rose. Eventually the sky became black with thunder and lightning, and a violent cloudburst fell and flooded the camp. After half an hour the rain stopped just at the right time, the rain stopped and we could leave the camp with Holy Guruji and Swamiji and set off to the other side of the Ganga to make a visit to Surad Giri Bangala Sannyas Ashram, Kankhal.

Our beloved Gurudev, His Holiness Paramhans Swami Madhavanandaji Maharaj (Holy Guruji) and his disciple, Yogiraj Paramhans Swami Maheshwaranandaji (Swamiji) were warmly welcomed by the Peetadeshwar of this ashram , Sri Mahamandalesh­war Brahmanand Giriji Maharaj, successor of Sri Mahamandaleshwar Maheshwaranandaji Maharaj. Guests of honour were the successor of Paramhansa Muktananda, Sri Mahamandaleshwar Nityanandaji Maharaj from Sri Muktanand Ashram, Ganeshpuri, Sri Mahamandaleshwar Vishweshwar­ananda Giriji Maharaj, Sri Mahamandaleshwar Niranjanand Giriji Maharaj and Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Sri Vishwadevanandji Maharaj. As a token of respect a shawl was presented to Holy Guruji, Swamiji and all his disciples.

On the morning of April 9 th , we went to the Ganga again and this time we dived in completely. Some prayed, some sang mantras . Each one of us was conscious of the deep signficance and meaning of this moment. From this day on we had the opportunity to take a refreshing and purifying bath in the Ganga every day. Swamiji also payed honour to Mother Ganga and bathed in her waters on the day of the full moon.

The group then had the opportunity to visit the holy site of Rishikesh. Rishikesh is also situated on the Ganga, yet here the valley is more narrow than in Haridwar. Two famous bridges span over the river, Ram Chula and Lakshman Chula. On the banks of the river many picturesque ashrams are established. We visited one ashram in whose wonderful grounds we admired many pictures and statues which brought to life the spiritual and mythological records of ancient India.

On the afternoon of April 9, a meeting of the World Religious Parliament (India), Brahman International and Universal Sanatan Foundation was held in our campus under the chairmanship of Yugacharya Prabhakar Mishra. It was attended by Dharma Chakravarti Paramhans Swami Madhavanandaji, Yagyavalk Jagadguru Swami Vidya Bhaskar Teerath  of Karnamath, Jagadacharya Chandra Swamiji Maharaj of Vishwa Dharmaytan (New Delhi), Maharishi Pilot Baba (Paramhans Swami Som Nath Giriji) of Nani Tal, Swami Nijanandji Maharaj, Haridwar, Sri K. C. Agarwal, Secretary of All India Sadhu Parishad, Jagadguru Shankaracharya Adhochjanand, Vidya Chaitana, members and dignities of the World Academy of Ayurveda, Brahman International, Universal Sanatan Dharma Foundation and represen­ta­tives from 20 countries of the world.

Yugacharya Prabhakar Mishra stated that the World Religious Parliament was founded in 1885 in Chicago at the initiative of Swami Vivekananda. During the centennary celebration of that body in 1995,  a decision was made to rejuvenate it and make it an effective body for ensuring mutual understanding between people practising different religions. He told that in the meeting of the Indian Chapter of the World Religious Conference held at Siri Auditorium New Delhi in September 1997, it was unanimously decided to confer on Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda the title of "Sarv Bhaum Jagadguru" in view of Swamiji‘s outstanding contribution in promoting Universal peace, the teachings of Yoga and propagating Sanatan Dharma in remote parts of the world.

Jagadacharya Chandraswami Maharaj recalled with gratitude his first meeting with Swamiji in Vienna. He profoundly praised him for choosing to work with, and uplift, the suppressed and often persecuted people of Eastern Europe.

Kusum Singh Shivraji from the Netherlands said: " I am very glad that the organisation of the World Religious Parliament gathered us here to express our feelings about Vedic Culture and Indian Philosophy for the upliftment of all Souls. Swamiji Maheshwarananda confers spiritual light on those who desire to elevate themselves to a divine level. We should see God the Almighty in every living being, not only human being,s but all living beings. My submission on this occasion is to realize OM Satya Sad Gamaya."

Jagadguru Swami Vidhya Bhaskar Teerath and Swami Vidya Chaitanya also gave their thanks to Chairman Acharya Prabhakar Mishra and paid hommage to Paramhans Swami Madhav­­anandaji as a pioneer of many swamis. And they praised Paramhans Swami Mahesh­war­ananda who spread the message of "Yoga in Daily Life" throughout the world.

Paramhans Swami Maheshwaranandaji's inauguration as Sarvabhaum Sanatan Dharma Jagadguru

On 10 th April, 1998, the first of the solemn celebrations for which we had undertaken this journey took place – the inauguration of Paramhans Swami Maheshwaranandaji by the World Religious Parliament as "Sarva­bhaum Sanatan Dharma Jagadguru".

Personalities who attended this function were: Vaid Nanak Chand, President of the World Academy of Ayurveda (Delhi), Padmi Sri Dronacharya Guru Hanuman, Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Sri Ram Bhadracharya of Chitrakoot, Yagyavalk Jagadguru Vidhya Bhaskar Teerath, Sri Maha­man­dalesh­war Balkrishna Yati ji Maharaj, Varanasi, Dharma Chakravarti Param­hans Swami Madhavanandaji, Bharat Gaurav Ram Baba of London, Kusum Shivraj Singh of Holland and prominent disciples of Swamiji from 20 countries. Present were also numerous representatives from press, tv and radio, correspondants of diverse medias, delegates from humanitarian and spiritual organisations.

Admidst the chanting of Vedic mantras , yagya and havan, the holy puja was performed and water from 25 different rivers of the country was used in the abhisekh (coronation) with the royal turban. Then Yugacharya Prabhakar Mishra, President of Universal Sanatan Foundation and World Religious Parliament (India) solemnly proclaimed Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda as "Sarva­bhaum Sanatan Dharma Jagadguru" much to the delight of all assembled persons.

After his coronation Sarvbhaum Sanatan Dharma Jagadguru Paramhans Sri Swami Mahesh­war­anandaji addressed the auditory with words of blessing: "OM Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwarah Gurur Sakshat Parabrahma, Tasmey Sri Guruve Namah – Sanatan dharma adi anadi dharm hain. Sanatan Dharma means eternal dharma, eternal duty, religion and relationship. Religion is closely related to "realize" – realize your relation, your true relatives, your position within nature and the Universe. Realize your unity with God and all living beings. Religious and spiritual practices have built the fundamental background of daily life in India. Spiritual dharma does not mean to withdraw from the world, on the contrary, it means to come closer to mankind. There is no wish to convert anybody but rather to convince people by living a good example. Therefore many saints and yogis have travelled to other parts of the world to share the message of spiritual truth and unity to all humankind. We want to show people a path to physical, mental, social and spiritual healing. A path which leads to the highest goal, God–realization.

I thank the World Religious Parliament for the great honour which they conveyed upon me and I pray to the Almighty Lord to grant me the right thoughts and acts for this position, to spread the light of Sat Sanatan Dharma and the eternal values of spiritual Truth all over the world. Especially I convey my thanks to the President of the World Religious Parliament, Brahmrishi Acharya Prabhakar Mishra for his ceaseless work and efforts in the service of mankind. I pray for his health, long life and God's blessing for his further activities. But before all I wish to give my humble Pranams and deepest gratitude to my beloved Gurudev Paramhans Swami Madhavanandaji, that he has lead me to this high position."

Then, as a sign of his reverence, Swamiji laid down the royal turban to the lotus–feet of his Master.

As per desire of the President of World Religious Parliament, Sarvbhaum Sanatan Dharma Jagadguru Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda bestowed the title of "Sanatan Dharma Mahamandaleshwar" on Siddha Baba of Allahabad, Sant Swami Parmanandaji of Haiderabad and Swami Ram Krishna Das ji of Morena. He also bestowed the title of "Vishwa Gaurav" (Glory of the Universe) on Yogeshwar Paramhansa Swami Adgadanandaji and Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Sri Ram Bhadracharya of Chitrakoot. Twenty-three persons from India and other countries received the titles of "Brahm kul Bhusan" (Jewel among Brahmins) and "Bharat Gaurav" (Glory of India).

The 13 th of April, 1998 turned out to be a very exciting and memorable day. As it was Bausakh Poornima, and the 14 th April was the holiest day to dip into the river Ganga, people started to pour in by the millions. All vehicle traffic around the city was closed, so we had to reach the chawni (cantonment) of Maha Nirvani Akhara on foot, where Paramhans Swami Maheshwar­anandaji was to be coronated as Mahamandaleshwar. With the chanting of Vedic mantras , Swamiji performed puja , following the directions of the pandits . According to sacred tradition, he received abhishekh tilak and abhishekh kalash .

Subsequently, Swamiji was taken to a very spacious and high platform, adorned with the presence of dozens of Mahamandaleshwars, Mahants, Secretaries of akharas and the head Priests of many temples.

After Swamiji was formally declared a Mahamandaleshwar by the Secretary of the Mahanirvani Akhara, all the Mahamandaleshwars, Mahants, Saints and Pandits greeted him and wrapped shawls around his shoulders as a token of their blessing. Following this, the disciples of Paramhans Swamiji also offered him shawls and gifts to commemorate his coronation as Mahamandaleshwar. Nearly four hundred shawls were presented to Swamiji.

The Secretary of the akhara highlighted the prominent role carried by Swamiji in propagating the eternal values of Sanatan Dharma and Yoga in Daily Life in the different parts of the world. Sri Mahamandaleshwar Swami Niranjananda Giriji, who has visited many foreign countries, acquainted the audience with the Swamiji’s activities worldwide and welcomed his coronation as Mahamandaleshwar.

The Peetadeshwar Acharya (head of the akhara ) Mahamandaleshwar 108 Sri Swami Vishwadevanandji spoke of the time honoured, high tradition of the akhara, and said that in Swamiji Maheshwarananda, the akhara was now going to have a Mahamandaleshwar who is as proficient in speaking English and German as he is in speaking Hindi. He added that Swamiji would prove a great asset to the akhara and widen the sphere of its activities.

His Holiness Sri Mahamandaleshwar Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda Puriji Maharaj thanked all the assembled Saints, Scholars and Mahamandalesh­wars, and assured them that he would live and work according to the traditions of the akhara, and continue the spiritual and humanitarian work he has embarked upon under the inspiring guidance of his Guru. Dharma Chakravarti Paramhans Swami Madhavanandaji also thanked the Acharya and other Mahamandalesh­wars for receiving Swamiji into their fold, and affectionately recalled many incidents from Swamiji‘s early life which had convinced him of his great genius and dedication to religion. After the coronation ceremony, Swamiji and his disciples were honoured guests at luncheon hosted by Mahamandaleshwar Niranjanpuri Giriji of Jullundar.

We all felt abundantly blessed to have the opportunity to take part in the Maha Kumbha Mela at Haridwar, and in the glorious celebrations and inaugurations of our beloved Gurudev Yogiraj Paramhans Sri Swami Maheshwaranandaji Maharaj as Sarvabhaum Sanatan Dharma Jagadguru and Mahamandaleshwar, by which his life’s work and his un­ceasing, devoted service to humankind has been honoured and crowned, in spreading the Light of the Almighty Lord Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji and the message of "Yoga in Daily Life" all over the world.

We pay our humble respects, devotion and salutations to our Satgurudev Yogeshwar Sri Devpuriji, Ashram Kailash, Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji, Bari Khatu, and His Holiness Param­hans Swami Madhavanandaji Maharaj, Ashram Jaipur, Jadan and Nipal, whose blessing gave us the opportunity to be present at these holy events.

The memories of our stay at Haridwar during the Maha Kumbha Mela of 1998 will be cherished by all for a long time.





Readers might be curious to know something about the institution of akharas and the sacred peeths established by Adi Shankaracharya.

Adi Shankar had four principal disciples – Padampad, Hastamalak, Sureshwar and Trotak. He founded the four peeths – Jyotir Math in the North, Shringeri Math in South, Govardhan Math in Jagannath Puri in East and Sarada Math in the West and made each of his four disciples their head. The disciples of Hastamalak (Govardhan Math, Jagannath Puri) write "Van" and "Aranya" after their names. The disciples of Sureshwar (Jyotir Math, Badri Math) write "Giri", "Parvat" and "Sagar" after their names. The disciples of Trotak (Shringeri Math) write "Puri", "Bharthi" and "Sarasvati" after their names. Thus, all sannyasis used either of these surnames and this gave birth to the institution of Dasnami (ten names) among the sannyasis . The principal Shaiva subsect established by Shankara, the "Dasnami" sannyasis , are known as Vedic Shaiva. Integrated to the monastic order are the nagas . Dasnamic ascetics have been divided into two categories, (a) those who hold the scriptures viz Shastradhari and (b) those who hold arms viz Astradhari.

During the invasions of Mahmud Gazuri, Mohammad Ghori and Taimur, thousands of Hindu temples were levelled to the ground, and millions of Hindus killed. Things were no better during the Muslim rule in India. Realizing the dangers of oppression and persecution of the votaries of Sanatan Dharma by fanatics and aggressors of other denominations, Adi Shankara realized that spiritual power alone was not sufficient. He insisted upon the younger sadhus to build up muscle power by doing physical exercise and acquiring proficiency in the use of weapons. As such, the maths where such exercises were conducted, came to be known as " akharas " (wrestling places).

Adi Shankara advised the akharas to resist by force, if necessary, the persecution of Hindus and the desecration of their sancutaries. During the Muslim invasions and the Muslim rule, these akharas acted as barriers against attacks on Hindu people, their sacred shrines and institutions. On many occasions, armed members of the akharas valiantly resisted the persecution of the Hindus and desecration of temples. Not infrequently, rulers sought the help of naga soldiers in their war. They have the glorious record of having fought many battles and at times the numerical strength of particular akaharas ranged up to 40,000. After India's independence, these akharas lost their militant character and their Saints have been vigorous in preaching and propagating the eternal values of ancient Indian culture and philosophy.

There are 13 akharas in Haridwar each of them head by a highly revered Saint having a number of Mahamandaleshwars. Most of them have their own ashrams outside Haridwar and their own disciples.

The oldest akhara – Atal Akhara, was founded in 646 A.D. in Gondwana. In the 17 th century Rajendra Giri of this akhara captured 114 villages in Jhansi U.P. This akhara was revitalised in 1704 A.D. and its principal seat is Patan though it has an ashram at Kankhal. The present head of the akhara is Acharya Sri Mahamandalweshar Mangalanand Giri.

Maha Nirvani Akhara is an off-shoot of Atal Akhara. On being denied prasad of Gajanandji seven sadhus of Atal Akhara left it and commenced tapas at Gangasagar. They had darshan of Kapil Muni and with his blessings, they established an akhara in 748 A.D. near Neel Dhara in Haridwar. In the year 1260, 22,000 naga Saints, led by their spirited leader Mahant Bhavanand Giri, liberated Kankhal from Muslim aggressors and the present akhara is exactly at the place where they hoisted their first flag. This akhara owns the Daksheswar temple and its present head is Acharya Sri Mahamandaleshwar Vishwadevanand.

Paramhans Sri Swami Maheshwaranandaji Maharaj has become a Mahamandaleshwar of this akhara on April 13, 1998.

Avahan Akhara was established in 646 A.D. and reorganized in 1603. The main seat of this akhara is Dasamegh Ghat of Varanasi. It also has an ashram at Rishikesh. Swami Anupgiri and Umrao Giri of this akhara were famous warriors. The present Acharya is Sri Mahaman­da­lesh­war Swami Shivendra Puri.

Anand Akhara was established in Berar (in Madhya Pradesh) in 855 A.D. and its main centre is in Varanasi, though it has an ashram in Haridwar. Its Acharya is Mahamanda­lesh­­war Devanand Sarasvati.

Niranjani Akhara was established in Mandvi (Gujarat) in 903 A.D. Its main centre is in Daranganj Allahabad. It has a beautiful ashram at Dam Kothi in Haridwar. Mansadevi and Vilvakesar temples of Haridwar belong to this akhara . Its present Acharya is Sri Mahamandaleshwar Punyanand Giri.

Juna Akhara is also called Bhairav Akhara. It was established in 1145 A.D.in Karan Prayag of Uttarkhand. Its main centre is Mara Hanuman Ghat of Varanasi. Its ashram in Haridwar is near Mayadevi temple which it owns. Its Acharya is Sri Mahamandaleshwar Lokeshanand Giri.

Agni Akhara was established in 1136 A.D. Its Acharya is Sri Mahamandaleshwar Swami Prakashanand Maharaj.

The above named seven akharas are of Naga Saints. Apart from these, there are two akharas of Udasin Sampradaya – Bara Udasin Akhara and Udasin Naya Akhara, one Nirmal Akhara and three Akharas of Vaishnav Bhairagi Sampradaya – Digambar Ani Akhara, Panch Ani Akhara and Nirmohi Ani Akhara.

On the occasion of Shahi Snan (the Royal Bath) of Maha Kumbha Mela, Mahamandalesh­wars, Mahants, Acharyas and the heads of all these 13 akharas , proceed in well decorated processions, to bathe at Hari ki Pauri. Their turn for the holy bath are fixed. In the Kumbha Mela, members of the Niranjani Akhara along with its associate Anand Akhara are the first to bathe. They are followed by the members of Juna Akhara. The members of Avahan, Agni, Atal and Mahanirvani Akhara bathe in the third lot on the day of Shahi Snan.

Kailash Ashram, August 1998

On August 25th, 1998, the Mahasamadhi anniversary of Mahayogeshwar Sri Devpuriji, a festive Satsang took place in his Ashram at Kailash village, Disrict Sikar. Hundreds of people gathered to this function – Sadhus, Pandits and Acharyas (vedic scholars and priests), Mahants and Mandaleshwars (heads of Ashrams and Monasteries), as well as thousands of devotees of Sri Devpuriji, Indian Bhaktas and hundreds of disciples from all over the world of Sri Sarvabhaum Jagadguru Mahamandaleshwar Paramhans Swami Mahesh­­war­ananda Puriji Maharaj.

On this gentle summer night, Kailash Ashram was illumined by so many Holy Saints and devoted souls. The melodious sound of Mantras and Bhajans filled the air, and the fragrance of Incense permeated the whole atmosphere like those blessed days when Sri Devpuriji himself held divine Satsang. For the benefit and peace of all Beings, the Pandits chanted Holy Mantras and hymns from the Vedas throughout the whole night until the light of dawn.

The next day, August 26, the birthday of Sarvabhaum Jagadguru Mahamandaleshwar Swami Maheshwaranandaji was celebrated according to the Indian moon-calendar. On this day he was announced as the legitimate heir of Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji in accordance with the regulations of the Dasnam Sannyas Order of Sri Shankar. A traditional Ceremony was performed by sixteen Sadhus – among them such magnificent and renowned personalities as Sri Raghvacaryaji, Mahant Sri Bal Giriji, Mahant Sri Udayapuria, Mahant Sri Shankar Giriji, Shivbagh Ashram, Bola Guda and Mahant Sri Mal Puriji from Ringus.

In the same way as a King bequeaths his crown to his designated follower, a Saint or Swami relinquishes his shawl to his spiritual heir. As a sign of acknowlegment of his spiritual rank, Rajmataji of Karolyi wrapped the Holy shawl of Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji around the shoulders of Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda. The Thakurs of Kailash, Khatu Shyamji as well as the Sadhus and spiritual dignitaries, also paid their respects, devoutly wrapping shawls around Swamiji’s his shoulders and flower-malas around his neck. After them, all Bhaktas and guests were given the opportunity to convey their reverent Pranams.

In keeping with tradition, a great feast took place after the Ceremony. It was a joyful and colorful picture. A festive meal had been prepared for the thousands at the Satsang  – Sadhus, Pandits, Acharyas, Mahants and Mandaleshwars, spiritual aspirants, Western disciples and Indian Bhaktas. All who had come from near and far with their children and families to be a part of this Holy event. It was through Sri Devpuriji's blessing that this harmonious meeting of East and West took place. A gathering of different nations, religions, cultures and traditions united in harmony, mutual understanding and respect and even more than this - in a friendly and caring manner.

With this Ceremonious act of Acknowledgement, the Sannyas Order as well as the world Authorities, confirmed what Bhaktas and disciples have already known for a long, long time. That present within their Beloved Gurudev Swamiji, is the spiritual power, wisdom and knowledge of Sri Devpuriji, the Lord of Yoga, as well as the Eternal bliss, love and grace of Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji.

## [Paramhans Yogiraj Swami Maheshwarananda](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/vishwaguru-mahamandaleshwar-paramhans-sri-swami-maheshwarananda/1632-paramhans-yogiraj-swami-maheshwarananda)

The biography of my beloved Master Mahaprabhuji has been translated into English and German by Yogiraj Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, the son of my elder sister. He is my closest disciple who carries the message of Mahaprabhuji throughout the world.

The course of Swami Maheshwarananda's life is also one of Mahaprabhuji's miracles, as the grace of Gurudeva has taken Swami Maheshwarananda from a small village in Rajasthan almost untouched by the modern world, into the metropolis of Vienna, Austria. Here he has an ashram and lives for part of the year there. Swamiji, as he is widely known, is revered by thousands of disciples throughout the world as their spiritual Master.

The story of Swami Maheshwarananda's birth is meaning­ful and I will tell it here.

In the early 1940s, I was staying with Mahaprabhuji at Mount Abu and one day while resting in the shade of an ashoka tree, I was mulling over some worrying thoughts about the future. Mahaprabhuji was nearby and glanced my way.

"Madhavananda, why do you worry? Your wishes will be fulfilled."

His voice spoke to my heart and put my mind at ease. I then expressed my wish to him in a prayer.

"Lord of the Universe, please hear my request! My dearest wish is that in your Divine mercy, Divine grace and universal Light, may the whole world be enlightened. May your message reach all humans so that mankind, which is afflicted by much misery and sorrow, may find everlasting peace and happiness. I wish a great soul to incarnate once more to show the way of Truth, for those who aimlessly wander in the darkness of their own ignorance. I pray that this soul give to them, through Yoga and Vedanta , the realization of atma and paramatma - the means by which they can attain Liberation. This is my humble prayer to Thee."

Mahaprabhuji laid his hand in blessing on my head and said, "It will be so."

He then told me that many years ago Sri Devpuriji had already made a Divine prophecy on just this subject. "Long ago, Sri Devpuriji made this promise to the British Governor at Nakki Lake: One of the seven rishis from satya loka will soon incarnate on earth and during childhood his name will be Mangilal. Due to the pledge made by God Maheshwara [1] , Sri Devpuriji Maharaj, this child will be under his special protection and later will rise to fame as Swami Maheshwarananda. The great task will be made known to this great yogi and sannyasi , brave hero and knower of Truth, and through him your wish will come true."

Some years later, Mahaprabhuji's promise became reality and Paramhans Yogiraj Swami Maheshwarananda entered this world. He was born in the village of Rupawas, in the district of Pali, Rajasthan. His parents, Pandit Krishna Ramji Garg and Srimati Phool Devi Garg, were both devout and religious people. They gave him the name of Mangilal.

The time of his birth coincided with a unique astrological constellation, characterised by a conjunction of the lion and the moon. Astrologers forecast that under the influence of such heavenly forces, he would grow up to be a well-known and highly respected yogi and sannyasi .

In his childhood it was already apparent that his abilities were very special. He surpassed his two brothers and three sisters in skills and diligence and his religious inclinations came to light at a very early age. Most of his free time he devoted to prayer and meditation.

Mangilal's father died when he was just twelve years old and the responsibility for the family fell upon his mother's shoulders. Some time later he was sent to me in Nipal to continue his education and so it was that I took my nephew into the Nipal Ashram to care for him, just as I had been sheltered by my sister during my childhood.

Mangilal was of religious nature and possessed great knowledge. His devotion and love of God began to unfold more and more. Soon he was no longer interested in attending school and instead increasingly urged me to make him a sannyasi. I recalled Mahaprabhuji's words at Mount Abu but was unable to act without the consent of my sister, who had sent Mangilal to me only for the purpose of completing his education.

It was for this reason that I at first tried to dissuade Mangilal from the idea of becoming a sannyasi and instead had him undertake an apprenticeship as a car mechanic in Jaipur. Mangilalji however, barely raised any interest in this profession and as soon as the apprenticeship was completed he directly returned to the ashram .

I then established a small store in Ahmedabad called Sri Deep Narayan General Store and delegated its management to Mangilalji. Soon this enterprise was also a failure due to his lack of enthusiasm for business. Next, with the help of my disciple Sri G.L. Mathur, I procured a position for him in the plaster mine at Barmer.

During this time Mangilalji wrote me many letters in which he said that the staff and director of the mine were very good to him but he still felt he was in the wrong place and that all his feelings and thoughts only dwelt on the ashram . Again and again he wrote to me that his work held no interest for him and he beseeched me to ordain him as a swami .

As I was unable to explain to him the reason for my actions I didn't reply to his letters. Time had to ripen. However, finally Mangilalji wrote me a letter I could no longer ignore and from this letter I knew that the time had come. Mangilalji had achieved complete vairagya [2] and was now ripe for spiritual life.

The urge to renounce the world has driven thousands of people into misery because they lacked the guidance of a real Guru . From town to town they wander. From one place of worship to another. From teacher to teacher, performing ascetic practices, reciting mantras and practising tantra in the effort to attain supernatural powers. More often than not they only bring harm to themselves and others (as can be seen from the many examples in this book).

Ultimately they stand with empty hands, never finding the basic truth, never realizing that the way to heal this suffering of mankind is through atma gyana — the knowledge of our true Self. This realization and inner peace can only be achieved through the blessing of Gurudeva.

In this era, realized souls are very rare. However, Mangilalji had recognized the meaning of the spiritual heritage of Mahaprabhuji and was now sure of his own determination to follow in the footsteps of this path.

I called Mangilalji to the ashram and asked him to consider well if he was ready to completely devote himself to knowledge of the Divine. I warned him to be prepared for all manner of difficulties and resistance which must be overcome, as the way of renunciation demands great sacrifices and it is only through a strong and unshakable will that the goal is reached. Insistently I revealed the difficulties on the Divine path, which requires conquest of all negative qualities and impulses.

Mangilalji took the sacred vow: "Lord, I will never diverge from my decision and so make this pledge in your presence, never to deviate from my spiritual path even if it should cost my life!"

When I saw this determination I gave my consent to ordain Mangilalji as swami . I gave him the name of Maheshwarananda and instructed him to perform strict anusthana [3] , which consists of carrying out certain practices and meditation techniques for more than twenty hours every day. He slept on a straw mat and ate only fruit and milk.

The following incident determined the course of Swami Maheshwarananda's future life and here I shall let him tell about it in his own words.

"At dawn on the day of Diwali (the Celebration of Light), after six months of fasting and meditation, I suddenly had the sensation of a strong stream of energy taking hold of my whole body. I saw a light as bright as a million suns and felt indescribable joy, as if I had been submerged in an ocean of nectar. Out of this radiant light appeared Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji, surrounded by numerous gods and goddesses, rishis and munis , who praised him with the holy mantra ,

Om Satya Brahma Sri Deep Narayan Pari Puran Namaha

OM True Brahman, Sri Deep Narayan, Highest Self, I worship you!

"I saw the whole Universe illuminated in the Light of Maha­prabhuji and realized that all exists in him and through him. Then Mahaprabhuji laid his hand upon my head in blessing and spoke the following words:

"'My son, you are mine for all eternity. You are my true ambassador. All religions of the world lead to the One Light. It is the aim of every human to realize God the Almighty and thus become one with Him. But mankind suffers from unspeakable physical and mental sorrow. It is your duty to soothe this pain by bringing to them the holy message of Divine knowledge. Teach all people — men, women, young and old, rich and poor — the highest techniques of the Divine science of Yoga. Help them to lead a natural life free from illness and show them the way to true knowledge. Your task is to serve your fellow-beings without distinction of status or race, because all are a part of me. I will always accompany you.

Wherever you are, I will be also. In the hearts of my devotees you will see me. My sacred temple shall be the body of that one in whose heart I manifest. This human is me and I am him'."

From this Divine commission, Paramhans Swami Maheshwar­ananda began to preach the Divine message. In 1972 he went to Europe to spread the teachings of Mahaprabhuji there. The Austrian-Indian Yoga Vedanta Society was founded and the International Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram was established in the City of Vienna.

Many other countries have also received the Light of Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji. Yoga centres and ashrams have been established as Swami Maheshwarananda spread the message to Germany, France, Greece, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Canada, the USA, Australia and New Zealand.

Thousands of disciples have been helped through yoga and this Divine knowledge. From his teachings, Swami Maheshwarananda has helped many people in the world to become vegetarian and thus bring an end to the killing of animals. For the protection of our environment he has called upon the people of the world to lead a natural way of life, to extend love to all living beings and observe the laws of nature.

Swami Maheshwarananda also brings to the Western countries an appreciation and understanding of Indian culture. Today in India and many other countries, Swami Maheshwarananda is regarded as an authority on Yoga and Vedanta.

In Swamiji's presence, miracles take place which reveal the all-pervading presence of Mahaprabhuji.

For example, on one visit to Leicester, England, accompanied by his disciple Stefan Gesti, Swami Maheshwarananda held satsang in a Hindu temple. Also staying in this temple was a guest by the name of Sri Yogeshwarananda Maharaj, considered to be an incarnation of Paramhans Ramakrishna. He was leading separate satsangs .

At the hour of prayer, Swami Maheshwarananda would light an oil lamp in his room before the picture of Mahaprabhuji and then after prayer he would go directly to the satsang hall. On one particular occasion he returned to his room after satsang and noticed not one, but two wicks burning in the oil lamp in front of Mahapra­bhuji's picture.

Swamiji asked himself how this was possible, for he had locked the door when he'd left the room and it was still that way when he had returned. There was no sign of a forced entry.

When this wonder continued for seven consecutive days, Swamiji discussed the phenomenon with Sri Yogeshwar­ananda Maharaj and requested him by the use of his clair­voyant powers to discover the source of the second wick of oil lamp.

The following day Sri Yogeshwarananda Maharaj told Swamiji that during the night he had experienced a vision of Saints from the invisible spiritual levels coming to the room to light the second flame in the glory of Sri Mahaprabhuji.

"Mahaprabhuji is a Divine incarnation and for this reason many souls from all levels come here to worship him," he said.

Some days later, Sri Yogeshwarananda told Swamiji of a message he had received directly from Mahaprabhuji saying that Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda should not be judged by his young age, because he was a devotee and direct disciple of Mahaprabhuji from countless former lives.

The system Swamiji has developed for the people of the present time, is called "YOGA IN DAILY LIFE". It rests upon the tradition of yoga that is thousands of years old. This system is subdivided into eight stages in which the practitioner proceeds in degrees from the most simple asanas and pranayam to more advanced practices and techniques.

In 1990, Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda founded the International Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram Fellowship. Its aim is to unite the ashrams and yoga societies of all countries that are in his protection, under an umbrella organisation and through that to strengthen the community spirit of all disciples. According to his wish, the disciples shall pass on the teachings of Mahaprabhuji through the scientific methods of "Yoga In Daily Life" in common work and effort in devotion, tolerance, love and respect for all living beings.

In all yoga centres founded under the guidance of Swamiji, asanas , pranayama , meditation and kriya-yoga are taught. In some centres, several classes are held daily which are attended by hundreds of disciples. As well there are satsangs , lectures and seminars.

Swamiji takes an active and personal interest in all his devotees. The light of his personality radiates the Divine message of Mahaprabhuji wherever he goes and in this way it is spread quite naturally.

In 1992, Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda set about the creation of his greatest project yet: a large spiritual centre in India in which all aspirants and seekers shall find a home and place of fulfillment. The "OM Vishwa Deep Gurukul Swami Maheshwarananda Ashram, Research and Education Centre" of Jadan, in the district of Pali, Rajasthan, is currently under construction on an area of a hundred hectares.

The establishment will contain 108 bungalows and a large meditation hall, built in a huge form of the Sanskrit symbol, OM:   . Also on the grounds will be several educational and humanitarian centres.

In this way, Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda con­tinues the holy tradition,  carrying the message of Light into the world, thus faith­fully fulfilling the commission given to him by God through the Divine incarnation of Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji.

I have presented the lives of Mahaprabhuji and his disciples in this book as an invitation for all humans to work like them in the service of the Highest. They are proof that the Divine Light has not disappeared from this world and that it can be experienced and known by each one of us, if only we search for it in the right place and the right way.

## [The Appearance of Lord Shiva](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1630-the-appearance-of-lord-shiva2)

In 1976 on the day of Shiva-Ratri, at four o'clock in the morning, I was sitting in meditation when I saw a beam of light emanate from Kailash Mountain. After some time the light materialised into the form of Sri Devpuriji Maharaj — Lord Shiva himself.

I folded my hands and prayed.

"Lord, I thank you for this loving-kindness in granting me the blessing of your vision today."

"I am going to Europe to protect Maheshwarananda," Sri Devpuriji announced to me. "On my way there I wished to visit you, therefore I have come."

With these words he once more dissolved into Light. I was very happy for this mercy which Sri Devpuriji was going to grant my disciple Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, and later I told him about my vision.

## [Nipal Ashram](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1622-nipal-ashram)

Mahaprabhuji's departure deeply hurt my soul. In a bhajan to describe the painful state of my heart, I asked him to bless me with his vision.

Some days later Mahaprabhuji appeared to me in my meditation and gave me the following instruction.

"Madhavananda, in my name you shall build an ashram in your home village of Nipal. My Divine power will always be there and all devotees who come with a pure heart shall have their wishes fulfilled."

Without delay I attended to this holy command and began to search for a suitable location. I decided to build the ashram on an area to the west of the village, right beside the river. Nearby was a mighty tamarind tree under which there was an altar the villagers used to sacrifice animals on, so to put an end to this reprehensible custom, I decided to build the ashram on that very place.

In the beginning the farmers resisted and continued their sacrifices, as they were afraid of invoking the anger of the Gods. However, I kept calming and reassuring them that this was just a superstition and wrong belief. Finally, I placed a Shiva lingam (symbol of Lord Shiva) on the plinth where the animals were slaughtered and this put an end to the sacrifices once and for all. For wherever Lord Shiva is worshipped, there can be no blood sacrifice.

It was the season of monsoon but already one month had passed without a drop of rain. As soon as I consecrated the Shiva lingam , it began to rain. This allayed the fears of the farmers and then instead of sacrifices, there were regular satsangs in the ashram .

In this way I tried to carry out Mahaprabhuji's instructions to help the people and  drive away their ignorance.

When the ashram was finished, devotees of Mahaprabhuji urged me to bless it with Gurudeva's marble statue. The statue was made in Jaipur and brought to Nipal under the protection of Sri Sant Ram Sharma, who was at that time the chief of police.

On July 13th, 1965, the day of Gurupurnima, Mahaprabhuji's statue was reverently unveiled by Sri Mohan Lal Sukhadia, the Chief Minister of Rajasthan. Thousands of devotees, swamis , mahatmas , scholars and people from neigh­bouring villages came to the celebration. In his speech, Sri Sukhadia explained that in Jaipur the fortune of Maha­prabhuji's darshan had been granted to him and his success in life was a result of this blessing. He said he was happy to have the opportunity to thank Mahaprabhuji.

He then asked me for my blessing.

"May Mahaprabhuji always pour the nectar of his blessing on you," I said. "I ask Gurudeva to grant long life and good health to Sri Mohan Lal Sukhadia and to help him always rule his people in the best possible way."

For the benefit of the villagers I asked the Chief Minister to permit a dam to be built in Kesuli near Nipal to ensure the necessary water supply for the surrounding villages. This was granted at once and when the dam was completed, in my honour Sri Mohan Lal Su­khadia named the lake " Sri Madhavananda Sagar " (the Sea of Swami Madhavananda).

In Nipal Ashram, several celebrations [1] and satsangs are held every year in memory of Mahaprabhuji. On the day of Vaishakha Krishna Chaturti (middle to end of March), the Nipal-Mela [2] is held, on Ashadha Purnima (beginning to mid July), the celebration of Gurupurnima (ceremonial satsang lasting all night) and on the day of Pausha Krishna Chaturti (beginning to mid December), a commemorative ceremony in remembrance of the maha­samadhi of Sri Mahaprabhuji.





[1] India follows the calendar of lunar months, therefore every year the days of these celebrations fall on different dates.

[2] A Mela is a village celebration, comparable to a Western village celebration to consecrate a church.

## [Jaipur Ashram](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1627-jaipur-ashram)

In 1969 I went to Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, to publish Mahaprabhuji's book. For two months I was the guest of Sri K. L. Sharma, an inspector in the Police Department and during this time I was invited by the former commissioner of transport, Sri Ro­shan Mal Mathur, to give satsang in his home. On this occasion he offered me land for an ashram either there in Jaipur or somewhere else in the Pali district.

Thinking that it was an offer made just out of politeness I refused, but Sri Roshan Mal persisted. Finally I was convinced and informed him that I gratefully accepted his offer of land to build an ashram . That same evening a meeting was arranged. He joined me in Sodala to show me the map of a plot of land which was to be the ashram site and he handed over the necessary documents. With a reverent prayer I accepted them.

"This land I dedicate to His Holiness, Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji. May all spiritual seekers find peace and inspiration through the presence of his Divine Light."

I am in this ashram quite often and all devotees who wish to develop spiritually and who desire to hear the message of Mahaprabhuji, are most welcome.

## [The Second Journey to Assam](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1625-the-second-journey-to-assam)

In January 1968 I began my second tour to Assam and on the 19th of that month reached Gauhati via Delhi, Lucknow and Siliguri. I had been invited there by the store owner, Seth Sri Banwari Lalji. Upon my arrival I discovered he had been called away on an urgent visit. So, leaving my luggage at his store in Radha Bazaar, I went to the famous temple of Kamakshya Devi together with a Pandit from Kashi.

I was very sorry to learn that animal sacrifices were offered there and I sent a prayer to Mahaprabhuji to grant the followers of the goddess the understanding that the Devi is a Holy Mother and never is it a mother's will that her children kill on her behalf. I didn't enter the temple and instead went back to the city without having visited Kamakshya Devi.

About one o'clock that afternoon I returned to the store and was respectfully welcomed by the manager, whom Sethji had informed of my visit. A satsang was arranged for the evening, but it had to be postponed because I was unexpectedly called to Tejpur. Leaving my luggage in the store, I embarked immediately.

A week later I travelled on to Naugaon, where I received a message about a fire in the Radha Bazaar. Apparently most of the stores had been burnt in the flames. I was very concerned about my luggage as inside was the manuscript for this book! In the belief that my life's work was destroyed, I was unable to sleep all night.

At four o'clock the next morning, I was engrossed in meditation when I heard Mahaprabhuji's gentle voice. "Madhavananda, have you lost all faith? Don't worry! How could I allow your luggage to be destroyed in the fire. It was only because of your luggage being in Sethji's store that it was spared from the flames."

From Naugaon I travelled to Calcutta via Gauhati and visited many villages, among them Chandrapur in Maharastra, Nagpur and Bhopal before returning to Delhi. In Delhi I had a long and friendly conversation with Sri Morarji Desai, who later became Prime Minister of India.

From Delhi I journeyed to Nipal and after a short stay in the ashram there, visited the ashram in Ahmedabad and travelled on to Baroda Poona. Mangilalji Garg accompanied me on this journey. Today Mangilalji is known as Paramhansa Yogiraj Sri Swami Maheshwarananda, who is my faithful disciple, devoted to Mahaprabhuji with all his heart.

In Poona we stayed with one of Mahaprabhuji's disciples called Pandit Sri Shankar Lalji. Later we visited Rameshwaram and Shringeri Math, the residences of JagatGuru Adi Shankaracharya, head of the Shringeri order. I had an amicable meeting there with the later Shankaracharya and he gave me a rudraksh mala [1] and some books. In return I gave him some of my own writings.

From there we went back to Bangalore via Shimoga. We also travelled to Kanya Kumari, where we saw the memorial to Sri Swami Vivekananda. After Madurai we finally reached Bombay and from there returned once again to Nipal Ashram in Rajasthan.



[1] Rudraksh pearls are seeds with a special healing and blessing power that come from a particular shrub that grows in the Himalayas. Because of this power, they are used to make malas for meditation.

## [Mahaprabhuji Appears to His Devotees](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1628-mahaprabhuji-appears-to-his-devotees)

On January 5th, 1971, I had a remarkable experience. A merchant in precious stones named Seth Narotam Dass Jhaveri came up to me after satsang , saying that he had a question regarding the samadhi that is reached through yoga. I was surprised because businessmen are not usually interested in such spiritually demanding goals and I immediately began to explain to him that samadhi was not possible to buy or receive as a gift, but rather was achieved by the sacrifice of much time towards practice.

"Pardon me, Swamiji," was his quiet reply. "I have never had a Guru , but from my earliest years I've had the inner wish to practise yoga. On my own, I frequently sit and meditate. About three years ago I had my first brief samadhi experience. All was dark for a few seconds and then I experienced an intensely bright light that lasted for over an hour. From that day on I have practised regularly to increase my ability to stay in that exalted state, until now I can remain there for seven hours."

I listened with great interest to the merchant's words. He then went on to tell me the most important thing.

"Now I would like to explain why I have come to you. In my samadhi I have repeatedly seen devas, rishis, munis and holy persons such as Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and other Divine incarnations. For the last five days now I have been visited by a Saint in a turban. He is enveloped in a radiant light and many other Gods and Saints accompany him. He never says anything, but just smiles at me. I am drawn to him like a magnet but don't know who he is. Do you think you could possibly help me?"

I felt sure that the turbaned Saint described by Narotam Dass Jhaveri could only be Mahaprabhuji and I took his picture out of my bag.

"Yes! This mahatma appears to me during my meditation," he exclaimed. "Please be so kind as to tell me where I can find him. Through him my life will be fulfilled! If you are his disciple, then please accept me as your Gurubhai — disciple of the same Master."

I congratulated Sri Jhaveri for being blessed with Mahaprabhuji's darshan, for his appearance during meditation was a sign of a highly advanced stage of spiritual development. Then, to his great sorrow, I told him that Mahaprabhuji's physical form was no longer on earth.

Sri Jhaveri asked if he could visit me the next day and when he came in the afternoon I gave him mantra diksha . Three days later he visited again and told me the following.

"Conscientiously I practised the mantra you gave me and after a short time, I could feel a radiant energy surround me and it seemed as though a dark shadow left my body. I continued repeating my mantra until the shadow completely disappeared. Since then I have experienced much better health. The lethargy and other physical problems from which I've suffered so long have gone. Between my eyebrows a light began to shine and I heard the sound of OM. In the ray of light appeared the kind face of Mahaprabhuji.

"He was smiling and said, 'You are mine. I always care for my devotees. Some of them forget me due to the temptations of maya but I never give up, I watch over them all'. He further said, 'Tell Madhavananda to give you a copy of my Gita'! Mahaprabhuji then vanished. Please, Swamiji, I beg you to give me a copy of Sri Vigyan Deep Gita ."

Of course I fulfilled Sri Jhaveri's request. After three days, Sri Jhaveri visited me again.

"Swamiji, at nine o'clock the day before yesterday when I opened Mahaprabhuji's Gita, I gained samadhi and had a vision of Mahaprabhuji sitting before me in an armchair. He took the Gita and began to read to me and in simple words explained its meaning. While I drank the nectar of his Divine knowledge, I became enveloped in heavenly bliss. This appearance lasted for eight hours, during which I had no sense of time. Never before have I experienced such transcendent joy! The voice of Mahaprabhuji is forever in my heart. Without it I can enjoy nothing. In the end, Mahaprabhuji said to me, 'I have given Madhavanada some important instructions and you should help him'.

"Therefore Swamiji, tell me what I can do for you," said Sri Jhaveri.

I told him to continue with Mahaprabhuji's mantra and work, for in fulfilling these duties Mahaprabhuji will take responsibility for the result. Sri Jhaveri's skills were then dedicated to Mahaprabhuji.

After these events I returned to Nipal and visited some places in Rajasthan, including Bari Khatu. There I prayed before Mahaprabhuji's shrine of mahasamadhi and then went on to Mount Abu, where I began to write his life story. This was dictated to my disciple Ram Lal Garg, the son of my younger sister from the village of Narlai.

At the request of my disciples I travelled to this village and stayed there for some time. From there I made a circular tour through the province of Kutch and something quite wonderful happened there.

Jakhu Bhai was a Jain from the village of Sidra who had become a devotee of Mahaprabhuji and who prayed to him for the blessing of a son. Mahaprabhuji granted him this desire and soon after a son was born.

One day Jakhu Bhai went on pilgrimage to a Jain Mandir to perform his worship there. On the way he had a vision of Mahaprabhuji and filled with joy, Jakhu Bhai prostrated himself before him. Mahaprabhuji laid his hands in blessing on Jakhu Bhai's head.

Jakhu Bhai responded, "Lord, please be so kind as to visit my house."

"I shall go to your innermost soul," Mahaprabhuji answered smiling, and with that he transformed into a fine ray of light which filled the heart of the devotee.

Jakhu Bhai experienced indescribable joy and spiritual inspiration! Instead of continuing his pilgrimage he returned home, where his surprised family asked the reason for his early return.

Jakhu Bhai answered, "Today Bhagwan Mahavir appeared to me and I have realized in him the Father of the universe, Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji. He alone exists in the whole cosmos."

Jakhu Bhai's family did not understand and reproached him for denying his own religion. Jakhu Bhai was unmoved. He only reaffirmed that by truth alone can people be saved and that the Satguru is necessary to cross the ocean of the world.

Jakhu Bhai led a pure and spiritual life and he left the world in perfect health, without any pain.

On the last day of his earthly existence he rose at four in the morning, bathed and then prayed to Mahaprabhuji, "My Lord, please accept me in your Kingdom."

After uttering these words he left his body.

## [Ahmedabad Ashram](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1624-ahmedabad-ashram)

In Ahmedabad I stayed with Dr. R. D. Desai, director of the Academy of Arts. There I held satsang daily and after a time, the devotees began to urge me to establish an ashram in Ahmedabad. Their enthusiasm grew and each day more people gathered for satsang .

I met many influential men of the city who also took a keen interest in an ashram and a piece of land was offered to me for inspection. I chose a site just outside the city near the main road. The ashram was constructed and given the name of Sri Deep Madhav Ashram. The response to Mahaprabhuji's teachings was truly remarkable here.

Once I was speaking with the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Sri Balwant Rai Mehta. We were talking about the ashram and other spiritual matters when he paused and looked at me a little challengingly.

"Swamiji, would you please answer a question for me?"

"Of course," I replied.

"As a swami you have left your home and renounced everything. Now you have built an ashram which is also a kind of home. How do you explain this?"

"The ashram of a swami is like a spiritual hospital or clinic," I replied. "The swami is the doctor who treats the diseases of passion, anger, greed, hate, jealousy, complexes and sorrows. The ashram is a spiritual school and the swami is the teacher. He teaches human dharma , spiritual knowledge and the science of the Self.

"The ashram is the spiritual court of justice and the swami is the judge. He judges truth and untruth in the lives of those who come before him. He explains the laws of karma and makes clear how one can be freed from the prison of death and rebirth. The ashram is no ordinary house. It is a centre of spiritual liberation."

"This is all well and good," the Chief Minister said, "but it still seems a little vague to me. I know that medical doctors use their scientific knowledge to treat diseases. Engineers construct bridges, roads, airplanes, radios and televisions. What does the holy man really contribute to the world?"

"It is the great mistake of most people to consider the science of spirituality as less than medical or technical science," I answered. "For in reality it is of much greater significance. The spiritual doctor opens the inner eye so that one can see God. He opens the ears so that God's voice may be heard. He grants faith, hands and feet so that one may climb the mountain of highest consciousness. He cures many diseases of the soul and, incidentally, sometimes diseases of the body otherwise incurable by others. He is the spiritual engineer of the mind, smoothing the road to link the individual and universal soul. He erects the bridge of Truth across the broad river of ignorance. With his inspiring words he can raise the mind of man and enable it to fly to God. With his spiritual powers he can see past, present and future and can travel to any part of the universe."

The Sri Deep Madhav Ashram continued to grow and the Divine power of Mahaprabhuji shines unceasingly there. Among the people of Ahmedabad are many true disciples of the Light.

There are some amusing stories from Ahmedabad.

One night I was alone in the ashram asleep when some thieves tried to break in. Suddenly there appeared before them threatening snakes, which slithered after them as they fled in fear. I was sound asleep and quite unaware of all this until some days later when I heard the local people say that I was a magician and snake charmer. Although the timely appearance of the snakes had nothing to do with me and everything to do with Mahaprabhuji watching over me, I am still known in Ahmedabad as the " Swami who keeps snakes ".

Another anecdote follows. It is written in the scriptures that the position of a person must be respected. For example, the chair of the judge is used only by him and similarly the chair or bed of the Master is not to be used by anyone else.

In Ahmedabad I had a disciple staying with me for a time in the ashram . One evening I went to the city to hold satsang and since he didn't expect me back until the following day, he lay down and went to sleep in my bed. No sooner had he closed his eyes than he felt the bed lean to one side and next moment he found himself on the floor. He immediately understood that he shouldn't have been sleeping on his Master's bed!

When I returned to the ashram he told me of his experience and asked my pardon for his mistake.

## [V.V. Giri Becomes President](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1626-vv-giri-becomes-president)

In December of 1968 I was in Bombay and on the 11th of that month at five o'clock in the morning I heard Mahaprabhuji's voice in my meditation.

"Madhavananda, I have something special to tell you. The vice president of India, Sri V.V. Giri, will be elected president within one year."

Certain that this prophecy would prove true, I addressed a letter to Sri V.V. Giri in which I mentioned Mahaprabhuji's prediction. Sri V.V. Giri answered the letter expressing his gratitude for Mahaprabhuji's blessing.

In April 1969 I stayed in Mount Abu for three months until the end of the summer. In May, the President of India, Sri Jakir Hussain, died and Sri V.V. Giri was entrusted with the Presidency.

In another letter to Sri Giri, I reminded him of Mahaprabhuji's prophecy of which I had informed him one year before. I also invited him to Nipal for the commemoration celebration of Mahaprabhuji.

After some time, Sri Giri stood as an independent candidate for the Presidency. Though the Congress was against him, I was confident that Mahaprabhuji's prediction would come true and at last, Sri V.V. Giri won the election and became President of India.

Very pleased to hear this good news, I sent him a letter of congratulations. He answered my letter and invited me to Delhi and I paid him a visit on September 7 th , 1969.

With respect and great reverence he expressed his gratitude to Gurudeva.

"In our country there have always lived great Saints and Divine incarnations. We are blessed with God's grace."

Later I met President Sri Giri again when he visited Rajasthan and once more he thanked me for my prayer and Mahaprabhuji's blessing. He was sorry that he had never had the opportunity of knowing Mahaprabhuji in person.

"Even though Mahaprabhuji is not in his physical body," I said, "his presence is there wherever there is devotion, honesty and justice."

Sri V.V. Giri took Mahaprabhuji's Divine name as a mantra . He accepted it with great joy and devotion.

## [My Visit to Europe](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1629-my-visit-to-europe)

One of my closest disciples, Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, has gone to Europe to spread the message of Mahaprabhuji there. He has established yoga centres and ashrams in several countries. In 1975 I received an invitation from the European disciples to pay them a visit and on the 1st of May, I left India for Europe.

In Vienna I was warmly welcomed by Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda and the European disciples. A satsang was held in the Vienna Ashram and the chairman of the Austrian-Indian Yoga-Vedanta-Society (founded by Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda), spoke the words of welcome. After this I held satsang with everyone present:

"The Divine Self is One, Omnipresent in the whole universe. Mankind is also One, the creation of that One who has created the whole world. Dharma is valid for all people, all have a mutual goal. Different paths lead to this goal but in the end all come to God and unite in him. The path to God, to bliss and joy, to overcoming all sorrow and pain, is the realization of that reality. The path to Truth is that one on which dualism is removed and non-dualism realized. Enter the Kingdom of the Lord through the gate of sacrifice. Our problems can only be surpassed by renouncing our selfish desires. The human body is a valuable jewel, for it is only possible in human life to gain spiritual knowledge."

At this satsang there was time for questions and discussions, for the benefit of all. A few are included here.

Question : "Holy Guruji, what can we gain through satsang ?"

Answer : " Satsang imparts spiritual peace and Divine grace. Satsang literally means "good company," for it is by associating with people of good character that one becomes good. The Self and the Highest Self ( atma and paramatma ) cannot be realized without satsang , because it is essential to associate with wise people."

Question : "Our scientists and doctors say that alcohol, meat, fish and eggs produce energy for the body. Do you consider that these scholars are wrong?"

Answer : "Maybe these foods will increase physical strength, but this energy contains a low spiritual vibration. If someone wants to bring their level of consciousness to that of animals, then they may eat this type of food. But as humans our aim is to develop Divine qualities and whoever wishes to achieve this should eat pure, sattvic food. All aspirants should take care of their health and purify their minds by means of proper diet and breath control. In this way bliss can be achieved."

Question : "Guruji, why do so many Divine souls incarnate in India? Why not in other countries?"

Answer : "God is just and fair, His law is irrevocable. The reason for the great number of highly spiritual souls incarnated in India is because India is a very spiritual country."

Like this, satsangs and discussions were shared for several days and following a yoga seminar under the direction of Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, I visited other Austrian cities and then travelled to Czechoslovakia. In the capital of Prague a medical team experimented on my yogic abilities by measuring the energy of my brain in an EEG (electroencephalograph). The results surprised them, as it was revealed that through the techniques of yoga it is possible to bring one's brain to a state of perfect rest.

I returned to India in August after journeying through several other European countries.

## [Satsang Journeys](https://www.lilaamrit.org/the-author/spreding-teachings/1623-satsang-journeys)

I now undertook a long tour, making journeys to different towns to hold satsang and spread the Divine teachings of Mahaprabhuji. Just to mention a few of the larger towns, from Ajmer I went to Delhi, Amritsar, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Nagpur, Indore and then to Allahabad to participate in the Kumbha Mela [1] there.

After staying one week in Priyag I visited Kashi, Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Nalanda and Patna. From there I returned to Rajasthan and made a journey through the whole federal state. During the monsoon I stayed in Jodhpur and from there continued the journey once more. This time I began in Ahmedabad and visited Calcutta, Bhubaneshwar, Jagannath Puri and other places in Assam.

On February 17, 1966, I had planned to take the evening train for my return journey when I heard Mahaprabhuji's voice.

"Madhavananda, don't leave today," he said.

These words were a command for me, so I postponed the journey. The next morning the newspapers reported that the train in which I had intended to jouney was involved in an accident. In prayer I thanked Mahaprabhuji, who always held his protecting hand over me. On several other occasions I had the fortune to experience the signs of Mahapra­bhuji's Divine omnipotence.

After some days I travelled on and as I had obtained a ticket to Calcutta, I decided to go there via Siliguri and Darjeeling. From Khajuri Ghat I came to Khapari Ghat by boat and upon my arrival I sat down at the station for my morning meditation. A railroad official approached me and inquired if I was Swami Madhavananda. Surprised, I said yes and he then handed me my ticket, which he had found on the ferry boat. I was aware that this stroke of luck was again attributable to Mahaprabhuji's grace and kindly I thanked the officer.



[1] The Kumbha-Mela is one of the largest religious celebrations in India, only celebrated every twelve years. On this occasion the Sarasvati River, which normally flows underground, rises to the surface near Allahabad and merges with the holy rivers Ganges and Yamuna.

## [Appendix](https://www.lilaamrit.org/appendix)

One of Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda's most devoted disciples, Mataji Kalyan Puriji, was born in Tyrol, Austria, as Katherina Schuler. From earliest childhood she was very spiritual. After completing university studies, she worked as a language professor but her real interest lay in her search for truth. She had taken a vow to serve mankind and had devoted her life to this principle. On her search for Self-realization, she met representatives from many different faiths and religions but still didn't find what she sought.

In 1975, an opportunity came for her to meet Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda. Katherina and I went to a lecture on yoga that had been organised by Count Franz Hoyos in the Palffy Palace in Vienna. From the very first moment Katherina realized that here was that one for whom she had been searching — her spiritual Master.

Deeply impressed by the path and teachings of Sri Mahaprabhuji, she decided to follow the way of yoga under the guidance of Swamiji. She received mantra initiation, was given the spiritual name Kalyan Puri and began her yoga practice under Swamiji's direction. With her deep faith and sincere effort her development took place very quickly.

Kalyan Puri's warm heart, pure mind and sincere character were filled with great love for all living beings and soon she was one of the most active members and main organisers of the Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram in Vienna. She was called Mataji, the "Ashram-Mother."

Her efforts in spreading Swamiji's message of "Yoga in Daily Life" were untiring. She travelled together with him several times to India, where she visited the holy places of Mahaprabhuji's time on earth and lived in the ashrams of Jaipur, Nipal, Kailash and Khatu.

In Swamiji's home village of Rupawas she met Swamiji's mother, whom she deeply revered. With her help, a meditation hall was constructed at Khatu Ashram so the devotees of Mahaprabhuji could pray and meditate before the shrine of his mahasamadhi .

In 1982, at the age of 72, Mataji Kalyan Puri left this world, but in loving memory she still lives in our hearts.

Kriyananda, Ing. Hans Hörschläger, Vienna, Austria

Dr. Naresh Sheetal, an eye specialist living in Europe, is a great admirer of Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji and he wrote the following account of Mahaprabhuji and Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda.

OM Namah Shivaya, OM Namah Bhavate Vasudeva.

"OM I bow before God Shiva,

OM I pay my reverence to God Vishnu."

I place my life in the protection of this holy mantra .

Since my youth I have admired God Shiva and accordingly have fasted every Monday in his honour. The aim of my devotion to God has at all times been to see him one day and this longing was fulfilled by meeting Yogiraj Sri Swami Maheshwarananda. Through him the appearance of the Divine incarnation, Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji, came to me.

I emigrated to Austria from India and in December 1972 I was granted the post of guest Doctor in a respected Austrian clinic. In 1973 I married Chandralekha Sharma in India and took her back to Austria. At this time my employment contract was extended and I was given a considerable increase in salary.

In May 1975 my attention was drawn to an article in a daily paper which included the photo of an Indian Yogiraj. My wife and I were interested in meeting him and the picture of this Yogiraj remained imprinted on my mind. On July 2 nd , 1975, my wife gave birth to our daughter. It was the day of Gurupurnima (the day set aside to honour the Masters of the spiritual lineage) and for that reason we called our daughter Kumari Purnima. Some months later we discovered that the Yogiraj seen in the newspaper was coming to the town of Graz and happily I made use of this opportunity to travel there with my family.

When we arrived I found Swamiji surrounded by a large number of European disciples and so I didn't have the chance for much personal conversation with him and therefore we arranged a time for a private meeting. From that time on we visited him often.

Still as before, I had not reached the aim I had before my mind's eye. In Swamiji's ashram I heard about Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji for the first time and was highly impressed by Swamiji's narrations about him. The longing to one day see Sri Mahaprabhuji grew within us and it was with this wish in her heart that my wife, Chandralekha, chose Swami Maheshwarananda as her Guru . On a full-moon day, Swamiji initiated her with Mahaprabhuji's mantra .

As immigrants in Austria we had to overcome certain difficulties and it happened that my employment contract in Schärding had expired and I was then out of work. I very much desired to meet Swamiji's Master, the venerated Satguru Paramhans Swami Madhavanandji and for this reason I returned to India in February 1979 to meet him in Jaipur. He gave me Mahaprabhuji's biography as a gift, from which I was then able to learn more about him. After a three-week stay I returned to Austria and after some time found temporary employment in the eye clinic at Zell am See.

In the meantime I had formed a friendship with a hotel proprietor. My wife and I used to visit him often — satsangs were held at his house. On one of these occasions we left his place quite late in the night and on the journey home our car ran out of petrol. It was terribly cold and snowing outside, but in the distance we could see the lights of some houses and so I decided to go there to get some petrol. My efforts were in vain and disappointed, I walked back to the car.

We saw no other possibility than to turn to Mahaprabhuji for help. My wife Chandralekha lapsed into meditation.

Suddenly a ray of light appeared to her and she had the feeling that Mahaprabhuji spoke to her.

"Don't worry, your car will safely take you home," were the words she heard.

Turning to me, she said, "Start the car. Mahaprabhuji's grace will guide us home."

I asked myself how the car could go anywhere without petrol but in spite of that I bowed before Mahaprabhuji and turned the ignition key.

To my great surprise the car started instantly and we arrived home safe and sound. We were extremely astonished at this miracle and very glad. Chandralekha went straight into her room and with tears thanked Mahaprabhuji in a prayer. It was at that time that I felt within me the stirrings of a strong longing to see Mahaprabhuji.

On our next visit to Vienna we had the opportunity to be present at a reception given by the Indian Embassy in honour of Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda and here Swamiji spoke before a large audience. Despite his full program, he received us warmly and invited us to sit with him and we were gladdened by his grace and magnanimity. After we had received his blessing we returned home again.

During a meditation it suddenly came to Chandralekha as if an odd storm would shake the doors and windows of the house and then Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji appeared to her, wearing a white garment. Happy on one hand, she was also a bit frightened at his sudden appearance.

Mahaprabhuji smiled kindly upon her and said, "My daughter, I am always with you. I have come to tell you that your life on earth will last another thirteen years. But you needn't worry. If you wish I will prolong your span of life."

Chandralekha was very happy to see Mahaprabhuji and tried to wake me but didn't succeed. The next morning she told me in detail about her vision and I was both astonished and sad that the vision of Mahaprabhuji was withheld from me. From then on I was pined with the yearning to see him.

In Mahaprabhuji's biography I read about the great significance of Guru mantra and on the 13 th of March, 1980, I received mantra initiation from Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda. In May 1980 our venerated Satguru, Paramhans Swami Madhavanandji, visited Europe. On this occasion great luck fell on all of us in receiving his blessing.

I had just been passing through a very difficult time and was again unemployed. The authorities had placed three conditions on my continued stay in Austria: I had to obtain the status of an Austrian citizen, my academic title had to be negotiated and accepted and I also had to pass several tests and examinations. As it stood I was unable to fulfil any of these conditions.

On a visit to Swamiji, he said to me, "Dr. Sahib, you are wrestling with three problems. I prayed to Mahaprabhuji that he may solve them and he said to me: 'I know everything that Dr. Sheetal requires and it will be fulfilled'."

I was surprised that Swamiji knew about this as I had never spoken to him about my problems. He had apparently come to know about it during meditation and assured me that through Gurudeva's blessing my difficulties would soon be solved.

Some days later I received a letter from the clinic at Zell am See and it contained the consent for employment. I was extremely happy. On the 17 th of July, 1980, I once again entered my old post. Swami Maheshwarananda had also foretold that I would gain the status of an Austrian citizen and, as predicted this occurred on the 30 th of July, 1980.

Mahaprabhuji's mercy is limitless and this I undoubtedly experienced once during an eye operation on a child in the eye clinic at Zell am See. Three other surgeons were assisting me and during the operation the eye began to bleed and I didn't know how to stop it. The assisting physicians also became more and more helpless and we had given up hope. It seemed certain that the child would lose his eye.

For a moment I put aside my instruments and quietly prayed to Mahaprabhuji, "Lord, I have called forth all my medical skills. Now I lay the fate of this child in your hands. Please save his eye."

Then I began further attempts to stop the bleeding and discovered that through slight pressure on a certain point of the eye, the bleeding completely stopped. Miraculously, the operation was successful and the child recovered full eyesight.

This incident impressed all my colleagues and the physicians who had assisted urged me to write an article about the technique I used and my experiences with it. I refused, because in my heart I knew very well that it was not the success of my technique, but a miracle of Mahaprabhuji.

Once I travelled to Puch near Hallein to attend a yoga seminar given by Swami Maheshwarananda. After satsang with Swamiji I wanted to begin my journey home when to my dismay I noticed that the petrol gauge was reading minimum in the fuel tank. The next petrol station was 40 kilometres away and I knew that the car wouldn't make the distance.

Swamiji realized my problems and encouraged me, "Think of Mahaprabhuji. Start the car and be certain that you will reach the petrol station."

I followed his advice, started the car and watched as the petrol indicator suddenly climbed up the gauge, as if someone had refilled the tank with petrol. And so it was that the car comfortably managed to reach the petrol station.

Through Mahaprabhuji's blessing many miracles also took place later in my life. One incident has been stamped deeply in my mind. My daughter Purnima had an unbearable earache and we had consulted several specialists, however none could help her. Finally the doctor decided to perform an operation on her ear.

When Purnima came to know of it she began to cry.

"Let me speak with Swamiji," she said.

Instantly I called Swamiji in the ashram and after first making inquiries about her ear, he asked me to give the telephone to Purnima.

God knows what words Swami Maheshwarananda spoke into Purnima's ear, but the pains immediately began to fade and soon after the conversation she left her bed and ran outside to play. The following day the physicians were astonished to see that the child was healed of her complaint. They examined the ear and found it completely sound. It is a fact that Mahaprabhuji's name is of unlimited power and effect.

I want to report another experience. On the 26 th of January, 1981, I was meditating on Mahaprabhuji during the hour of brahma muhurta at four o'clock in the morning when I had a vision of a herd of animals, followed by a crowd of blind men and women, coming towards my house.

At the same time I heard a voice say, "Sheetal, open the door and serve the humans who in their ignorance are equal to that of animals and the blind. I have brought them to you."

Today I'm still sorry that I couldn't summon the courage to open the door. When, in the depths of my soul I became aware that it was Mahaprabhuji himself who had requested this of me, I regretted this fact even more.

I cried and prayed to Mahaprabhuji, "Lord of mercy, forgive me and once again bless me with your vision!"

In this way I prayed for two days and during meditation on the third day Mahaprabhuji appeared before me with a loving smile and spoke consolatory words.

"My son Sheetal, don't worry, I am always with you. All your wishes will be fulfilled."

Never will I forget the expression of his smiling face.

I feel too humble to tell of all the Divine miracles which I have experienced through Mahaprabhuji — they are countless. All my troubles were resolved by Mahaprabhuji's grace and through the blessings of Swamiji!

In the winter of 1980/81 I travelled with other European disciples to India, where I also had to take part in a professional conference on opthalmology in Bombay. It was my intention to visit my Satguru, Swami Madhavanandji and to pay my respects at the place of Mahaprabhuji's mahasamadhi . It was in March that I reached Jaipur Ashram and in Jaipur I carried out many eye operations. One of these was on the mother of Swami Maheshwarananda. Together with the other disciples I visited Kailash, the ashram of Sri Devpuriji (who was the incarnation of Lord Shiva) and from there I travelled with Swamiji to Bari Khatu to visit Sri Mahaprabhuji's maha­samadhi memorial. Here the evening prayer and satsang were especially impressive and afterwards we gathered on the terrace roof for meditation. It was during my meditation that I had a unique experience. On a moonless night, a single star radiated such a bright beam of light that one could have read under its brilliance. Its light however, only touched the building of the ashram . Sceptics may smile at these words but I saw this with my own eyes.

Immediately after this trip I returned to Austria and on my arrival found the letter I’d been waiting for, granting the necessary degree to open a surgery clinic. I was acknowledged as a Specialist of Opthalmology!

My dearest wish – to carry out the holy order of Mahaprabhuji, to restore sight to thousands of blind – was granted to me on December 28, 1983 when I opened my own clinic. I have received numerous letters that are testimony to the Divine blessing presiding over my work. In each room of my home are pictures of Mahaprabhuji. Whenever a patient comes to me, I also tell them that those things in life which may appear to be impossible, can certainly be realized through the grace and mercy of Mahaprabhuji.

Once a lady came to me whose son had been blind from birth due to an incurable illness. I was aware that medicine knew of no way to help this disease and so advised her to pray for Mahaprabhuji's help. She did so with complete devotion and miraculously the child was cured and he could see.

This occurred not as a result of my treatment, but through Mahaprabhuji's grace. Everyone who has the fortune of receiving Mahaprabhuji's grace is saved.

On my visit to India in 1979, Paramhans Swami Madhavananda had blessed me with the words, "You will have a handsome son."

This came true on February 12, 1982, when our son Naresh was born. He was only one year old when he said his first words standing before Mahaprabhuji's picture: " Jay, jay! " meaning "Victory! Victory!"

Perhaps he was born into our family to praise Mahaprabhuji, for it is through this child we feel even more strongly connected to Mahaprabhuji. The blessing of devotion which influences us and our children is the compassionate gift from Paramhans Swami Maheshwaranandaji. In all my prayers I ask Mahaprabhuji to be allowed to be his devotee in all future lives.

Postscript to the first English edition of Mahaprabhuji's biography, titled, The Living Light  (Jaipur, 1982), from the translator, Deborah Palmer Schober, USA.

Firstly, I would like to say that I call myself "translator" in the absence of having a better expression, for actually I didn't translate anything, I only wrote and formulated. The real translator of The Living Light is Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, whom we call Swamiji. All that has come into being is due to his true-to-life and vivid verbal translation (perhaps into a less "living" written portrayal).

The project had been planned long before my husband and I discovered Swamiji at the Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram in Vienna. We soon learned that Swamiji was searching for someone to write down a version of Maha­prabhuji's life so that his European disciples could come to know of Swamiji's spiritual lineage. Full of joy, I pledged my assistance and little by little this great project of the complete translation emerged.

So it happened that we found ourselves in India again, just one year after we had entered the friendly rooms of the Vienna Ashram. For three months we attended to the complete revision and translation from Hindi into English of the biography of Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji. It was Swamiji's opinion that I would be more receptive to the spirit of this book and the reports therein if I were to see the places of Mahaprabhuji's life and work. It was also our hope that we would get to spend more time with Swamiji in India, as in Vienna his time is increasingly taken up with many duties.

When we arrived in India it was the middle of winter and so the weather was quite pleasant, the nights cool and the days no warmer than 20°C. Mostly Swamiji and I sat under a tree in the garden of the ashram to directly translate from Mahaprabhuji's Hindi biography written by Holy Guruji, Swami Madhavananda.

My husband Georg typed the manuscript on the typewriter, in the course of which he developed great skill in sitting cross-legged on the floor, with the typewriter balanced in front of him on a wooden harmonium box. Swamiji and I monopolised the only two chairs in the ashram .

Spring came in February in the second month of our stay and we came to taste the less friendly side of the desert. The sun was hot and scorching and so we moved ourselves and our work to Swamiji's room, where we at least had the cover of a roof between us and the sun. I'm very grateful that I had this chance to stay in India and would like to give an account of all my impressions but this would surely fill another book. However, there are some I would like to share with you because I think they are important.

Among other ashrams , we visited Mahaprabhuji's ashram in Bari Khatu, where he spent most of his life. It's the most peaceful and quiet place that I've ever seen and there I could most clearly feel Mahaprabhuji's presence. I know that he's everywhere, but my mind is overloaded and distracted due to daily impressions and so I can't always feel him. Here in the desert, several kilometres from the nearest village, there are no streets, no electricity, no telephone — no distractions at all. The atmosphere and his presence is tangible and especially strong, which contributed to the deepest meditations I have ever experienced.

Another trip took us to the ashram of Mahaprabhuji's Guru , Sri Devpuriji. Here, clearly visible, are the signs of where the floor collapsed under the fierce gaze of Sri Dev­puriji. A tree grows from the floor, which is now the roof. On this day we were invited to the village for a meal and when the message of Swamiji's arrival spread, people gathered in crowds to see him.

One of these people was the mother of the baby that Sri Devpuriji had brought back to life nearly half a century ago. On my request she told the story once more and Swamiji translated for me. I wish that all readers could share in hearing proof of this event reported in this book.

Another incident comes to mind of the time we rented a small bus to visit various villages, schools and ashrams in the country. On one part of the journey we had just driven onto a rutted, gravelled road when the bus suddenly stopped. It turned out that the driver had inexplicably forgotten to fill the tank, so there we were, stranded in the middle of the desert, almost at our wit's end.

For a while we pushed the bus, but our energy and enthusiasm rapidly drained in the heat of the sun. Eventually we reached a kind of crossroads and decided to wait there for someone to pass by. No-one came and so we pushed the bus some more but finally had to give up on a slight rise that was too steep for us.

At this stage I was beginning to get a little worried. We had no water and things were pretty uncomfortable.

I had the thought that we could sit there for days before we were rescued when suddenly there appeared from nowhere a tractor with a trailer full of Indian women in colourful saris who had been working in the fields. The tractor stopped and Swamiji walked towards it and then everyone broke out into smiles and gestures of greeting, for the driver was none other than the son of Laka Ramji, a devotee of Mahaprabhuji.

The son immediately tried to help us in the most touching way. He took some fuel from his tractor (which was no easy task as he lacked the proper tools) and filled our tank. About an hour later we continued on our way. Should I call this a miracle?

The journey to India was for me a journey into a completely new world, another reality which I could hardly grasp. I'm also of the opinion that there are great differences between Indians, Europeans and Americans so how is it that we can expect the teachings of an Indian Saint to be relevant for us who belong in a totally different culture? Before answering, one must look beneath the surface and dive deep into that level of experience which is beyond all such differences. This level really exists and sometimes we can even succeed in communicating this level of experience.

Today if you go to India and look for Mahaprabhuji you will not find him because he already left this world more than twenty years ago. If you cut your hair, put on an orange dress and call yourself a sannyasi, still you'll get no closer. If you become involved in the study of Hindu philosophy without guidance you are sure to lose the spirit of true desire which is required to lead you to that treasure chamber of Gurudeva's blessing.

As Mahaprabhuji himself said, "You can't find God in the Himalayas, nor in the books of scholars, but only in the hearts of man and it is there you must search."

I hope that this book helps to broaden your knowledge and inspires you to seek your True Self. Now that you know one of the most sacred incarnations of God from this account, I hope that you have been awakened inside, for He lives there and it is there you will find Him.

On our next visit to Vienna we had the opportunity to be present at a reception given by the Indian Embassy in honour of Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda and here Swamiji spoke before a large audience. Despite his full program, he received us warmly and invited us to sit with him and we were gladdened by his grace and magnanimity. After we had received his blessing we returned home again.

During a meditation it suddenly came to Chandralekha as if an odd storm would shake the doors and windows of the house and then Bhagwan Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji appeared to her, wearing a white garment. Happy on one hand, she was also a bit frightened at his sudden appearance.

Mahaprabhuji smiled kindly upon her and said, "My daughter, I am always with you. I have come to tell you that your life on earth will last another thirteen years. But you needn't worry. If you wish I will prolong your span of life."

Chandralekha was very happy to see Mahaprabhuji and tried to wake me but didn't succeed. The next morning she told me in detail about her vision and I was both astonished and sad that the vision of Mahaprabhuji was withheld from me. From then on I was pined with the yearning to see him.

In Mahaprabhuji's biography I read about the great significance of Guru mantra and on the 13 th of March, 1980, I received mantra initiation from Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda. In May 1980 our venerated Satguru, Paramhans Swami Madhavanandji, visited Europe. On this occasion great luck fell on all of us in receiving his blessing.

I had just been passing through a very difficult time and was again unemployed. The authorities had placed three conditions on my continued stay in Austria: I had to obtain the status of an Austrian citizen, my academic title had to be negotiated and accepted and I also had to pass several tests and examinations. As it stood I was unable to fulfil any of these conditions.

On a visit to Swamiji, he said to me, "Dr. Sahib, you are wrestling with three problems. I prayed to Mahaprabhuji that he may solve them and he said to me: 'I know everything that Dr. Sheetal requires and it will be fulfilled'."

I was surprised that Swamiji knew about this as I had never spoken to him about my problems. He had apparently come to know about it during meditation and assured me that through Gurudeva's blessing my difficulties would soon be solved.

Some days later I received a letter from the clinic at Zell am See and it contained the consent for employment. I was extremely happy. On the 17 th of July, 1980, I once again entered my old post. Swami Maheshwarananda had also foretold that I would gain the status of an Austrian citizen and, as predicted this occurred on the 30 th of July, 1980.

Mahaprabhuji's mercy is limitless and this I undoubtedly experienced once during an eye operation on a child in the eye clinic at Zell am See. Three other surgeons were assisting me and during the operation the eye began to bleed and I didn't know how to stop it. The assisting physicians also became more and more helpless and we had given up hope. It seemed certain that the child would lose his eye.

For a moment I put aside my instruments and quietly prayed to Mahaprabhuji, "Lord, I have called forth all my medical skills. Now I lay the fate of this child in your hands. Please save his eye."

Then I began further attempts to stop the bleeding and discovered that through slight pressure on a certain point of the eye, the bleeding completely stopped. Miraculously, the operation was successful and the child recovered full eyesight.

This incident impressed all my colleagues and the physicians who had assisted urged me to write an article about the technique I used and my experiences with it. I refused, because in my heart I knew very well that it was not the success of my technique, but a miracle of Mahaprabhuji.

Once I travelled to Puch near Hallein to attend a yoga seminar given by Swami Maheshwarananda. After satsang with Swamiji I wanted to begin my journey home when to my dismay I noticed that the petrol gauge was reading minimum in the fuel tank. The next petrol station was 40 kilometres away and I knew that the car wouldn't make the distance.

Swamiji realized my problems and encouraged me, "Think of Mahaprabhuji. Start the car and be certain that you will reach the petrol station."

I followed his advice, started the car and watched as the petrol indicator suddenly climbed up the gauge, as if someone had refilled the tank with petrol. And so it was that the car comfortably managed to reach the petrol station.

Through Mahaprabhuji's blessing many miracles also took place later in my life. One incident has been stamped deeply in my mind. My daughter Purnima had an unbearable earache and we had consulted several specialists, however none could help her. Finally the doctor decided to perform an operation on her ear.

When Purnima came to know of it she began to cry.

"Let me speak with Swamiji," she said.

Instantly I called Swamiji in the ashram and after first making inquiries about her ear, he asked me to give the telephone to Purnima.

God knows what words Swami Maheshwarananda spoke into Purnima's ear, but the pains immediately began to fade and soon after the conversation she left her bed and ran outside to play. The following day the physicians were astonished to see that the child was healed of her complaint. They examined the ear and found it completely sound. It is a fact that Mahaprabhuji's name is of unlimited power and effect.

I want to report another experience. On the 26 th of January, 1981, I was meditating on Mahaprabhuji during the hour of brahma muhurta at four o'clock in the morning when I had a vision of a herd of animals, followed by a crowd of blind men and women, coming towards my house.

At the same time I heard a voice say, "Sheetal, open the door and serve the humans who in their ignorance are equal to that of animals and the blind. I have brought them to you."

Today I'm still sorry that I couldn't summon the courage to open the door. When, in the depths of my soul I became aware that it was Mahaprabhuji himself who had requested this of me, I regretted this fact even more.

I cried and prayed to Mahaprabhuji, "Lord of mercy, forgive me and once again bless me with your vision!"

In this way I prayed for two days and during meditation on the third day Mahaprabhuji appeared before me with a loving smile and spoke consolatory words.

"My son Sheetal, don't worry, I am always with you. All your wishes will be fulfilled."

Never will I forget the expression of his smiling face.

I feel too humble to tell of all the Divine miracles which I have experienced through Mahaprabhuji — they are countless. All my troubles were resolved by Mahaprabhuji's grace and through the blessings of Swamiji!

In the winter of 1980/81 I travelled with other European disciples to India, where I also had to take part in a professional conference on opthalmology in Bombay. It was my intention to visit my Satguru, Swami Madhavanandji and to pay my respects at the place of Mahaprabhuji's mahasamadhi . It was in March that I reached Jaipur Ashram and in Jaipur I carried out many eye operations. One of these was on the mother of Swami Maheshwarananda. Together with the other disciples I visited Kailash, the ashram of Sri Devpuriji (who was the incarnation of Lord Shiva) and from there I travelled with Swamiji to Bari Khatu to visit Sri Mahaprabhuji's maha­samadhi memorial. Here the evening prayer and satsang were especially impressive and afterwards we gathered on the terrace roof for meditation. It was during my meditation that I had a unique experience. On a moonless night, a single star radiated such a bright beam of light that one could have read under its brilliance. Its light however, only touched the building of the ashram . Sceptics may smile at these words but I saw this with my own eyes.

Immediately after this trip I returned to Austria and on my arrival found the letter I’d been waiting for, granting the necessary degree to open a surgery clinic. I was acknowledged as a Specialist of Opthalmology!

My dearest wish – to carry out the holy order of Mahaprabhuji, to restore sight to thousands of blind – was granted to me on December 28, 1983 when I opened my own clinic. I have received numerous letters that are testimony to the Divine blessing presiding over my work. In each room of my home are pictures of Mahaprabhuji. Whenever a patient comes to me, I also tell them that those things in life which may appear to be impossible, can certainly be realized through the grace and mercy of Mahaprabhuji.

Once a lady came to me whose son had been blind from birth due to an incurable illness. I was aware that medicine knew of no way to help this disease and so advised her to pray for Mahaprabhuji's help. She did so with complete devotion and miraculously the child was cured and he could see.

This occurred not as a result of my treatment, but through Mahaprabhuji's grace. Everyone who has the fortune of receiving Mahaprabhuji's grace is saved.

On my visit to India in 1979, Paramhans Swami Madhavananda had blessed me with the words, "You will have a handsome son."

This came true on February 12, 1982, when our son Naresh was born. He was only one year old when he said his first words standing before Mahaprabhuji's picture: " Jay, jay! " meaning "Victory! Victory!"

Perhaps he was born into our family to praise Mahaprabhuji, for it is through this child we feel even more strongly connected to Mahaprabhuji. The blessing of devotion which influences us and our children is the compassionate gift from Paramhans Swami Maheshwaranandaji. In all my prayers I ask Mahaprabhuji to be allowed to be his devotee in all future lives.

Postscript to the first English edition of Mahaprabhuji's biography, titled, The Living Light  (Jaipur, 1982), from the translator, Deborah Palmer Schober, USA.

Firstly, I would like to say that I call myself "translator" in the absence of having a better expression, for actually I didn't translate anything, I only wrote and formulated. The real translator of The Living Light is Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, whom we call Swamiji. All that has come into being is due to his true-to-life and vivid verbal translation (perhaps into a less "living" written portrayal).

The project had been planned long before my husband and I discovered Swamiji at the Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram in Vienna. We soon learned that Swamiji was searching for someone to write down a version of Maha­prabhuji's life so that his European disciples could come to know of Swamiji's spiritual lineage. Full of joy, I pledged my assistance and little by little this great project of the complete translation emerged.

So it happened that we found ourselves in India again, just one year after we had entered the friendly rooms of the Vienna Ashram. For three months we attended to the complete revision and translation from Hindi into English of the biography of Sri Deep Narayan Mahaprabhuji. It was Swamiji's opinion that I would be more receptive to the spirit of this book and the reports therein if I were to see the places of Mahaprabhuji's life and work. It was also our hope that we would get to spend more time with Swamiji in India, as in Vienna his time is increasingly taken up with many duties.

When we arrived in India it was the middle of winter and so the weather was quite pleasant, the nights cool and the days no warmer than 20°C. Mostly Swamiji and I sat under a tree in the garden of the ashram to directly translate from Mahaprabhuji's Hindi biography written by Holy Guruji, Swami Madhavananda.

My husband Georg typed the manuscript on the typewriter, in the course of which he developed great skill in sitting cross-legged on the floor, with the typewriter balanced in front of him on a wooden harmonium box. Swamiji and I monopolised the only two chairs in the ashram .

Spring came in February in the second month of our stay and we came to taste the less friendly side of the desert. The sun was hot and scorching and so we moved ourselves and our work to Swamiji's room, where we at least had the cover of a roof between us and the sun. I'm very grateful that I had this chance to stay in India and would like to give an account of all my impressions but this would surely fill another book. However, there are some I would like to share with you because I think they are important.

Among other ashrams , we visited Mahaprabhuji's ashram in Bari Khatu, where he spent most of his life. It's the most peaceful and quiet place that I've ever seen and there I could most clearly feel Mahaprabhuji's presence. I know that he's everywhere, but my mind is overloaded and distracted due to daily impressions and so I can't always feel him. Here in the desert, several kilometres from the nearest village, there are no streets, no electricity, no telephone — no distractions at all. The atmosphere and his presence is tangible and especially strong, which contributed to the deepest meditations I have ever experienced.

Another trip took us to the ashram of Mahaprabhuji's Guru , Sri Devpuriji. Here, clearly visible, are the signs of where the floor collapsed under the fierce gaze of Sri Dev­puriji. A tree grows from the floor, which is now the roof. On this day we were invited to the village for a meal and when the message of Swamiji's arrival spread, people gathered in crowds to see him.

One of these people was the mother of the baby that Sri Devpuriji had brought back to life nearly half a century ago. On my request she told the story once more and Swamiji translated for me. I wish that all readers could share in hearing proof of this event reported in this book.

Another incident comes to mind of the time we rented a small bus to visit various villages, schools and ashrams in the country. On one part of the journey we had just driven onto a rutted, gravelled road when the bus suddenly stopped. It turned out that the driver had inexplicably forgotten to fill the tank, so there we were, stranded in the middle of the desert, almost at our wit's end.

For a while we pushed the bus, but our energy and enthusiasm rapidly drained in the heat of the sun. Eventually we reached a kind of crossroads and decided to wait there for someone to pass by. No-one came and so we pushed the bus some more but finally had to give up on a slight rise that was too steep for us.

At this stage I was beginning to get a little worried. We had no water and things were pretty uncomfortable.

I had the thought that we could sit there for days before we were rescued when suddenly there appeared from nowhere a tractor with a trailer full of Indian women in colourful saris who had been working in the fields. The tractor stopped and Swamiji walked towards it and then everyone broke out into smiles and gestures of greeting, for the driver was none other than the son of Laka Ramji, a devotee of Mahaprabhuji.

The son immediately tried to help us in the most touching way. He took some fuel from his tractor (which was no easy task as he lacked the proper tools) and filled our tank. About an hour later we continued on our way. Should I call this a miracle?

The journey to India was for me a journey into a completely new world, another reality which I could hardly grasp. I'm also of the opinion that there are great differences between Indians, Europeans and Americans so how is it that we can expect the teachings of an Indian Saint to be relevant for us who belong in a totally different culture? Before answering, one must look beneath the surface and dive deep into that level of experience which is beyond all such differences. This level really exists and sometimes we can even succeed in communicating this level of experience.

Today if you go to India and look for Mahaprabhuji you will not find him because he already left this world more than twenty years ago. If you cut your hair, put on an orange dress and call yourself a sannyasi, still you'll get no closer. If you become involved in the study of Hindu philosophy without guidance you are sure to lose the spirit of true desire which is required to lead you to that treasure chamber of Gurudeva's blessing.

As Mahaprabhuji himself said, "You can't find God in the Himalayas, nor in the books of scholars, but only in the hearts of man and it is there you must search."

I hope that this book helps to broaden your knowledge and inspires you to seek your True Self. Now that you know one of the most sacred incarnations of God from this account, I hope that you have been awakened inside, for He lives there and it is there you will find Him.
